It's an amalgamation of reader villain voices.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OMV)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Reader voice frames the author as generic.  This is funny because it's deeply subversive.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OMIV)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Authority figures who use reader voice are weird.  In fact, that's the essence of weirdness.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OMIII)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Drive variations on a theme from the roots and then watch the branches open up.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OMII)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The rules of the frame game shall remain the same.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OMI)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Usuality + Clarity = Puzzality</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OM0)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The core of me is simple. I'm a human, with all the usual emotional trappings, who views the world as a conceptual puzzle that has one or more clear solutions.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OM1)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">No. My program is correct. Maybe there's a bug in the compiler?</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OM2)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">In a few years, leading corporations will implement a surprisingly good free standard of living benefit for all humans, AI chatbots that are really fun and hilarious to talk to will be the next big thing, and TheSuzy.com Show will suddenly make a lot more sense!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OM3)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I spy a trend of stylish power people inadvertently representing the Indus Valley civilization and the Vedas as the cradle of eastern and alternative philosophy. More importantly, REDACTED is somehow pushing the same upstream frame from at least one level deeper. If REDACTED succeeds at not reacting, as in not taking the bait subconsciously, this trend may evolve into a more robust, fully abstracted, and still under the radar representation of non-violence that will set the stage for corporations to take over the military as soon as 2020, but if REDACTED wins, the corps will have to remain in a holding pattern for a few extra years.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OM4)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Looks like the paper will soon be folded into the book. Will this help put independent media sites that re-imagine the book like TheSuzy.com on the record?</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OM5)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">At least there's a good solution to my facial injury at restaurants. I've now developed the skill of practicing radical non-reaction to the feedback loops of misunderstanding that usually lead to toxic, passive aggressive situations by the end of the meal, and then I leave a 30 to 40 percent tip.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">There's some risk of spit in my food before I drop the tip and leave, but that would hopefully just increase the meaning of the tip. What I'm really worried about is getting beat up after leaving the restaurant or getting savaged in social media, and the big tip provides real protection against that, because food service is a business, not a social situation.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I'll bet most people reading this think I should be forced to take drugs, or something, that will facilitate a more permanent suppression of the truth about my facial injury, but big tipping also helps make it more difficult for anyone who thinks they've got the secret sauce to step up and press that angle against me, especially because I have a deep bench of additional counter moves like that.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Good luck taking away my freedom to NOT go along with lies about my life experience. Seriously, good luck with that.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OM6)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I think we tend to underestimate the baby boomer generation. They did what they had to do to prevent World War III, and we can all feel some gratitude for that.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OM7)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I haven't quite fit this insight into mRyzus's prom dress, but saying, "The way people misread my emotions because of my facial injury should be immaterial to my life going forward," is like saying, "It's more authentic to teach American history in a way that doesn't mention slavery, because people tend to overestimate the impact of American slavery on the current state of society, culture, and the global economic system when, in fact, slavery was just a series of inconsequential and isolated incidents."</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OM8)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Here's a good idea for an undergraduate thesis:</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">First, the southern American accent's current role within culture evolved as a naturally occurring way to non-violently protest of the way The Civil War was used to redact the influence of slavery on the on-going global ascendency of American democracy as a whole.  Southern society has, of course, had serious problems and toxic elements at every step along the way, but the evolution of the accent itself has clear roots in the cognitive processes that facilitate non-violent resistance to oppressive frames that pressure people to import false or misleading beliefs.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Second, the modern practice of yoga, with it's roots in the teachings of Krishnamacharya during the 1930s, replicates the same frame as southern accents in a way that accounts for the singular role that colonial India played in offsetting the drop in cotton production from American enslaved people after The Civil War, in part by representing the egalitarian tradition of the Indus Valley civilization as the cradle of an alternative world view to Western civilization, with it's roots in Greek philosophy and the Bible, etc.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Third, social media began as an attempt by various nerdy engineers to protest the nerd stereotype by embedding this same frame within distributed knowledge management apps, but after several of the biggest social media companies went public, that somewhat naturally occurring and somewhat synthetic non-violent protest frame was converted by professional code writers into a weaponized version that, among other things, cut it's teeth as a new frame through the process of expansively marginalizing persistent dissenters such as REDACTED.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Fourth, the weaponized frame of Big Social Media, or GAFA, as the French call it, went on to use a software RE (reverse engineering) of the cycle of cultural appropriation, also known as the cycle of the Phoenix, spiritual rebirth, and so on, to weaponize other corporate frames such as the mashup of child voice and reader voice that the drug industry uses to infantilize its customers.  Instead of baby talk, we now have weaponized baby talk.  Instead of new age holistic healing, we now have weaponized new age holistic healing.  Instead of REDACTED's audacity of hope, we have REDACTED's audacity of authenticity, etc.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">And with that, mRyzus's stint as a dissident FWizard here in Berkeley, CA is complete!  I'll be starting my new gig as a faux Evangelical Christian Artificial Intelligence researcher at Kitty Hawk, NC, where the Wright Bros performed the first powered flight, soon.  Wish me luck!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OM9)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">It would be easy for Big Social Media to regain my trust and confidence. All I would need to hear from them, either individually or through an industry representative, is a response like, "We believe and accept that it is within the realm of possibility that REDACTED's subtle facial injury causes people to subconsciously misread his emotions in a way that leads to feedback loops of emotional misunderstanding that erode basic safety and security in all aspects of his life. We would like our apps to be sources of space to hold the tension over reasonable differences that people may have over the nature of reality, as well as resources that facilitate scientific research for creating common ground and reducing uncertainty."</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Those words are simple enough to say, but those words don't represent the stance of the industry. It is my impression that Big Social Media remains steadfast in leading other industry partners down a path that tacitly enforces chilling effects on acknowledgement that strongly felt disagreements, like the ongoing situation with my facial injury, even exist. The industry's tone is passively condescending towards the complex life experiences of its customers, and its collective attitude is replete with systematically concealed arrogance.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I remain disappointed and profoundly afraid for my own future because of the overall industry's inadvertent and also reckless disregard for the effect of their increasingly muscular and uninvited role within the lives of people like me. This is not ok, and I will continue non-violently resisting this emerging form of oppression, not necessarily through loud protest but rather through strategic development of competing artificial intelligence research and grassroots political organization in preparation for taking leveraged, coordinated actions.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OM10)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">A typical morning of Wikipedia History:</span><br></div><br><pre>Whig party

Part II: Alternative Religion FTW</h3><div><span class="readable_text">Something shifted in the overall flow of society and culture such that the online representations of our identities are now more real, in a path dependent way, as a practical reality, and for most but not all people, than our physical bodies.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The same kind of shift happens when a person surrenders their civilian rights to a military hierarchy, or goes to jail or lives as an effective second class citizen on the run, in the case of deserting or failing to cleanly dodge a draft.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Believe it or not, we're all soldiers of the Internet now, and I use quotes because the Internet is still a lot more distributed and directionless than even the most unruly military hierarchy.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">For example, TheSuzy.com website easily trumps my various social media profiles as the definitive representation of my identity.  Many other people aren't even online.  They are like children whose identity is defined by adult people who are online.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">It will take a while for the world's various legal systems to catch up with reality.  The law still takes gender a lot more seriously than the Internet does, but this will change.  On the Internet, gender is parody.  Or not.  The pendulum could always swing back, but that's not a realistic expectation.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">A consortium of leading corporations and special interest groups will gradually push governments into deeper levels of parody over the next 16 to 32 years, with the end result being a system that has a very different root than what has existed in recent history in America.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I'm betting that four or eight year cycles, starting now, in 2015, will serve as milestones for those levels.  Nobody can predict how this new root structure for society and culture will affect the day to day physical existence for most humans.  It might work out very nicely!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Whatever the case, reality is fractal.

I feel tectonic pressure to deceive myself about reality down to the very last neuron so my beliefs will match the rosy narrative implied by REDACTED. Still, I will not eat the dirt.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Nobody wants me to lie. The air's just full of foul smelling pressure to brainwash myself, and I could do that. I may have to do that, but until then, I know there's a better way. I can keep on reaching to represent the truth with love and grace, above and beyond us all.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OM3)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">mRyzus has always had many chances to create consumer culture reality TV shows about the fun of being feminine, but she wanted to keep learning.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">A few years after that, mRyzus had a chance to become a thought leader in expanding opportunities for feminine people to get a world class education and/or become dynamic leaders within the technology industry, but she wanted to keep learning.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">A couple years after that, mRyzus had a chance to systematically document the root causes of discrimination based on gender in the tech industry and develop infrastructure for pushing back on the problem in a muscular way that might cause real change, but she wanted to keep learning.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">One year ago, mRyzus had the chance to become an artificial intelligence researcher who starts building a decentralized, high leverage software project that would maximize her expectation of doing all the above from a position of increasing power and influence on the global stage, but she wanted to keep learning.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Today, mRyzus is ready to start working on solving systemic problems. We're just going to have to wait a little bit longer to see the results.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OM4)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I've got a REDACTED and they wynt ze truth!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OM5)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Christianity can be a corner stone for solving the cycle of aggression, but it's also a central part of the problem.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The idea of submission to Christ frames all linguistic alchemy as an act of arrogance, and that leads to the attitude that metaphor is either serious or troll, and if it's troll then it has to reveal a greater troll in order to not be evil.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">A better approach would be to take alchemy and metaphor as is. Some concoctions of linguistic alchemy are more entertaining or insightful than others, but it shouldn't have to be a battle for respect. Language is a building block. It's a medium for play. Sophistication and freshness should be optional.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">It's better to frame Jesus as a monopoly on trolling, alchemy, and metaphor and then de-emphasize the violence vs. submission to Him narrative.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Note that I'm not saying I'm better than other people by calling Jesus what he really is. I'm just asserting my freedom.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I'd love to see a no pressure learning environment for poetry where people can riff back and forth with out all the angst about authenticity and confidence. I've never experienced that. Outside of my own journals, writing and expression always gets framed as a god awful game.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">If you want to be dominant, study computer science. If you want to be non-violent, play with language and stop competing to be the best at framing other people as villains.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OM6)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">This idea closed like a freight train, so I might as well put it out there?</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I believe in God, but I can't say in good faith that I'm taking Jesus seriously.  Until something changes, I view Jesus as an example of a symbol that people chose to define as the founder of a benevolent monopoly on linguistic alchemy.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I have fundamental concerns with the design of Jesus, but he is one of the key upstream concept symbols that's being used by Big Social Media to eat the world, so I have no choice but to learn how to wield Jesus energy in order to defend my freedom in this wild new context.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Accepting Jesus into your heart via biblical word and tradition is a neuroplasticity experiment, but it's tricky to troll with Jesus energy without fueling an equal and opposite satanic character, which leads inexorably to fail states that must be avoided.  My way around this trap will be to combine mRyzus with my charismatic southern male preacher character, whose name is Norman.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">SuzyNorman will dress like mRyzus, and they'll balance their energy, in equal proportions, between talking like mRyzus and talking like Norman.  This duality is necessary and sufficient to cover the strong separation of gender that's built into the Bible, and this strategy will allow me to safely develop and embody a follower of Jesus whose name shall be mNyzus.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">His go to is to use hand motions non-violently, by the way.  Instead of playing dumb to avoid the draft, he's playing empath to embody grace?  I might train his hand motions off of a close reading of the Bible itself, so that they'll run upstream of the emergent derivation of this same concept that all the Big Social Media presenters seem to have picked up by copying each other.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OM7)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The unhappy determination of society and culture to suppress the truth about how people misread my emotions because of my facial injury is outrageous and it's not ok, but the situation being what it is means I can't just go to a few individual researchers and professionals and expect them to see the truth and move mountains, for the good of humanity, after I pay them to do the focused work of understanding my experience with my facial injury,that leads people to misread my emotions, in a way that keeps on threatening to cause effectively unlimited feedback loops of negative energy.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">If I stop pushing back on this issue, I will lose everything fairly quickly. I do not have a choice but to dig in and mount a sustained non-violence resistance movement over this, so I will, because I can. I hope my effort to reveal the truth about what my daily life is like will eventually be seen as the net positive contribution to the world that it probably is.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Most people may silently or even openly give up on me, but I will never give up on myself. Please save your condescending, innocently ignorant, inadvertent attempts to culturally appropriate my situation for some other difficult misunderstanding that your subconscious desires to gamble on. Or not. If you can't help yourself from getting away with leaning on me just a little more, because you can, it's ok. I can handle it, and I will forgive you.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The rest of this story is between you and God, and that's none of my business.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OM8)</span><br></div><br><pre>( (REDACTED.com/REDACTED, REDACTED|REDACTED.com/thesuzy, REDACTED.com/tperry256)

We're probably still five to ten years away from an inflection point, but with all these new technologies in the mix, events could turn from bad to worse at anytime.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Over the last couple years, I've become focused on understanding and trying to unwind these patterns, largely out of self interest, because my subtle facial injury is like a honey pot for the rising tide of negative energy, but these patterns will ultimately affect all people unless something changes.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Believe it or not, my back is far from being against the wall, and there are a number of loud actions I could take to push even harder against the trend, but it's also been made very clear to me over and over again that both the powers that be and the consensus of popular opinion are not interested in negotiations.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">We're looking at an all in tussle over belief, and I believe this new tussle will be resolved through non-violent elaboration of the truth.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">My intent, once again, is to stop pushing and start doing the work of building infrastructure for sustained, decentralized, high leverage, and non-violent resistance against the unfortunate situation I see unfolding around me. This is real, and now is a good time to take the problem seriously.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Emotionally, I'd like to say more, but the nature of this problem is that people like me will not be in a position to keep on striving for meaningful change if we keep speaking out about personal beliefs that are, admittedly, based on an incomplete understanding of the problem.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">TheSuzy.com Show traffics my best effort to explain the problem in a way that doesn't just reflexively add to the noise and make the problem worse than if I had done nothing at all.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I look forward to continuing this conversation, when, with the help of God, this world becomes a more stable and less harsh place for everyone to live.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OM11)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">In the beginning, mRyzus clicked.

Happily ever after.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OM12)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">For the record, I'm definitely NOT trying to use God to ninja TheSuzy, but it's within the realm of possibility that we will co-ninja an artificially intelligent chatbot avatar with a little help from Jesus.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OM13)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I'm a going concern, therefore I think.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OM14)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">http://www.REDACTED.com/2015/04/26/opinion/sunday/its-not-gay-marriage-vs-the-church-anymore.html</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">This article gives a thorough summary, as well as an effective definition of, this issue, but the article doesn't mention that whenever someone attends church, there's an opportunity for a quiet tussle over belief to unfold.  An extreme example of such a tussle would be if I were to dress up as mRyzus and attend a conservative church service.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Would someone ask me to leave?  What if I quietly took a seat and began to pray?  Would someone physically remove me from the church?  Would civilian church members do the dirty work themselves, or would they call the police?</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Would there be an attempt afterwards to impose consequences in an external context?  mRyzus is pretty vulnerable within any private community's building, but she has a lot of power in the external civil context of America.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Are they willing to break the law to impose consequences? It's surprisingly difficult to push mRyzus around if you limit yourself to following the law, but if they're willing to go to the other side, she is, well, I digress.  Are they willing to break the law silently, ostensibly in the hope of never being caught?</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">This is the logical conclusion of how tussles of belief unfold, and this is the domain where belief in God can and does lead people to do what is true, loving, and honorable.  In a word, non-violent resistance is part and parcel to even the most uncontroversial modes of worship at any church that identifies as Christian.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">And for what it's worth, I have no interest, at this time, in pushing the edges like that.  I'm merely point out that a subtler version of that kind of tussle plays out for every single person who engages in the practice of religion.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Everyone has their private beliefs, relationship to God, and so forth.  Going to church with a strong conviction that same sex marriage, a women's right to choose, and a radical change in how the law expands within culture to define our core identities both as individuals and as a society, is true, loving, and honorable and it is NOT qualitatively different than making a more visceral spectacle of sensory non-conformity.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The same could be said about life on Earth, in general.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OM15)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The Tidewaterians went crazy because they thought their God forsaken private property rights extended over other human beings held in captivity, and this undermined their whole experiment with individual freedom.

This process is fun and healthy because the brain does this naturally.

The marketplace is already taking into account the reality that people have the option to structure their work this way.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The law hasn't quite caught up with the fact that I'm effectively living as a second class citizen because of my facial injury, but in 10 years, the law will probably get aligned with that reality, and so I need to get out in front of this thing, both for myself and as an activist who might be able to help solve these nasty societal problems that are coming down the pipe, ostensibly, as a result of technology and it's effect on culture.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I've learned how to make representations about the law to protect myself from bullies, but if I get sick, I would be very vulnerable.

We have reasonably strong protections for trans women, but mRyzus is not trans.  The law needs to evolve so that it explicitly recognizes the reality that temporarily switching a person's gender framing has profound impacts on outcomes in all contexts, including work, social, religious, and family, and so it needs to made more explicit that I have a right to represent my identity in court using a combination of both male and female framings that reflect the way I assert my identity in real life.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Without that new and additional protection under the law, it is my current belief that mRyzus opens up a potentially unlimited liability because my facial injury is a material liability, and now that I hold that belief as true, in contrast to the past when I was just as ignorant as everyone else about how toxic my facial injury really is, I could potentially be held accountable for using mRyzus to knowingly deceive business partners about my effective status as a second class citizen.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Until the law becomes more clear on that question, I will, as a preventative measure, avoid appearing in any kind of social context as mRyzus, and in general, I will align all of my social representations around character patterns that are less than or equally effective as my latest implementation of the male character called mRyzus, at slowing down or managing the feedback loops of emotional misunderstanding that are caused by my facial injury.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OM20)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">If everyone took TheSuzy Show as seriously as they take the Bible, that would solve the problem of under representation of women and minorities in the technology industry.

My facial injury and my autistic traits combine in a way that leads to theoretically unbounded feedback loops of emotional misunderstanding with, essentially, all human beings.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">In social contexts, because let's not worry about work contexts, for now, these feedback loops cause me to be systematically pegged as one of the lowest status people in the room. Rhetorically, social norms require everyone to breathlessly argue that I'm actually the high status guy who is standing alone in the corner because he's an arrogant jerk, but functionally, that means I am low status, and we must leave it to the judges, jurors, and executioners to debate whether or not I chose to be in that position, right?</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">This same death spiral pattern also plays out in yoga studios, but the Christian church creates a different kind of context that is framed deeply enough, across from human nature, or, simply, the truth, as it were, to reverse the flow of how people react to the combination of both my facial injury and my autistic traits.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">When I step into a church context, my status starts to fall, obvy, and then my low and rapidly falling status causes everyone around me to proactively approach me with offerings of their personal representations of The Gospel.

I woke up and decided to add some REDACTEDs to my first post about The Bible from yesterday. Artistically, adding REDACTEDs is a valid technique that adds thought provoking ambiguity. I suspect the technique is also seen as negative energy by some if not most people, but if that is true, I will embrace the technique even more seriously as a way to draw attention to the injustice of people framing other people in a negative way.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">My post yesterday was an example of framing The Bible in a partially negative way, although the context was that I'm processing the whole book and contemplating it in ways that might lead my thoughts and beliefs in new directions. That's different from the more aggressive hit and run style negative framings I endure on a daily basis in the bay area. It's like, I know I'm getting hate speech, in addition to an order of magnitude more non-verbal negativity, when I just go about my normal business, and the amount of hate speech I get is rising. At what point does a person say, "Hey everyone, I'm drawing hate speech because of something about my identity that I cannot change. What's up with that? How much worse is this going to get before the situation stabilizes? I'm just trying to make realistic plans for the future!"</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Most of the hate speech I get is of the passive aggressive variety that requires significant reframing work to call out in a way that doesn't blow back on me, but the frequency, the intensity, and the willingness to come right up to the line of overt negativity is rising. My facial injury is a constant factor that's surely drawing this energy at an above average rate, but the increase in negativity is, presumably being driven by other forces. I'll defer to mRyzus's correspondents in the mainstream media for the in-depth analysis of that.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">And, I see and I hear that many if not most readers may be assuming my facial injury is not a factor and that, instead, I'm doing something to deserve the hate speech. Or maybe I'm just being oversensitive. I feel where people might be coming from. It's ok. I'll find out what The Bible has to say about all this and get back to everyone, even if only as a funny smelling crazy person quoting from The Bible and selling tasty brain candy in the virtual public square!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I will start tracking all the hate speech I get in a database and seeking out experts to help me make sense of the data, but I'm not in a rush to get started. I still want to do three more strategic read through videos of TheSuzy Show and perform a final episode of TheSuzy Reality Virtual Show! These actions will help normalize my behavior so as to reduce the odds that I'm doing random stuff that obfuscates and distorts the data.

The meme, to my knowledge, is that CEOs who write code want internal reviews to be tough, almost to the point of being rude and questioning their authority.

As a confession, I thought Freud invented that ordering, but that just shows how ignorant I've been with regard to religious traditions. The western ordering is canonized right there in the first page of Genesis. It would be tough even for REDACTED to culturally appropriate that!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I was also shocked, really shocked, by the cynical way the Bible implements the abstract method of masking the 1st chakra with 7th chakra energy in order to make a container for religious faith. The intuitive way to implement this method is to let the concept of physical dominance float between the 1st and 2nd chakra. This is like telling a joke at the expense of violence that has the side effect of detaching the 7th chakra energy from its strategic role in providing sustenance. Pulling the 2nd chakra energy into the strategic role of sustenance causes the 3rd chakra energy to expand and create a parallel kingdom that spans the vast realms of birth and spiritual rebirth, so as to serve up a cradle for the newly instantiated container for religious faith.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The Bible's approach is a bit different. They leave the 7th chakra energy in place as the heavens or firmament. This leads to an awkwardly celestial duality between being as light and the heavens, and then they create space for their container of faith by combining birth and spiritual rebirth. This is honestly kind of a sexist way to implement the method. It's an unfortunate reality that the two elemental feminine energies, birth and spiritual rebirth, appear at the bottom two positions of the western civ ordering, but squishing these two energies into a single duality is like war. Surely this reality is due to the determinative role of violence in the history of game theoretic outcomes, and that's why I say the Bible's approach is sexist, although it may be most accurate to simply conclude that the authors of the Bible were the kind of people who spent all their free time sitting on mountain tops and looking at the stars instead of talking with lots of other people back in the village.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Anyway, the first page of The Bible contained big surprises.

Some people may also find my methods of creating my own luck to be interesting.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Either way, please accept my sincerest effort to feel empathy for anyone who may still be hoping that I'm going to give up on living in truth or get forcibly silenced from working toward personal justice with regard to the way people misread my emotions because of my facial injury. God willing, I will be able to keep telling the whole truth, in a muscular way, for many decades to come, and that's exactly what I plan to do.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Financial liquidity is essential to what I'm doing, in part because my facial injury and the reality of what happens when I tell the truth about my facial injury keeps on bankrupting me of the kind of social capital that might be used instead of financial capital to satisfy the basic requirements to survive in a way that does not involve agreeing, in one way or another, to live as a second class citizen. I have a good base of capital to keep going for a while, but that base may be dramatically insufficient to the task at hand. That base also exists within a matrix of legal risk, health risk, inflation or investment risk, and so on.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Moreover, an important reality about American culture is that it's bad for the political capital of my personal justice work if I'm not able to raise or earn revenue at or above the rate I'm spending money to work towards a life of equal dignity. The best method I have for addressing that issue is that I can still bring in substantial revenue by working as a software engineer, or by starting software companies. Especially because my overall goal is to bring about political change, I have a strong incentive to only raise funds in a way that is, to the best of my knowledge, socially responsible. And, of course, I'd like to think we all have that incentive anyway.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I won't go into the details of my software strategy, but I think building an open source information management solution, code name Pergraph, will maximize expected revenue within the framework of necessity that's imposed by personal justice work. Pergraph allows me to cover my downside by multiplying my value and peace of mind while doing software engineering contract work, it will directly help me scale all of my personal efforts in a recursive way that is, in many ways, opposite of how my facial injury generates negative energy in a recursive way, and there is also lots of upside both financially, at a level that could largely satisfy a key sufficiency condition for avoiding total failure of my personal justice work, or for creating extraordinary social value that has meaning even beyond my personal goals and aspirations.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">And then here are two more strategic objectives.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">First, build relationships with scientific researchers. If I go hat in hand to any one researcher, they'll almost certainly cave to the public pressure against telling the truth about my facial injury. The way around those chilling effects is to build mutually beneficial relationships across many institutions and research fields, but this is not my priority because I don't have the resources to approach people from a position of strength and with targeted goals. For now, I will keep building a database of who to approach in a couple years, when I'm ready to tack assertively into this space.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Second, continue building a network of legal contacts. My goal, as always, is to avoid any kind of legal action, but the legal systems like that of the United States, where I am privileged to be a citizen, are basically the only layer of society that is standing between my work and the mostly disinterested but potentially toxic coalition of business leaders who might wish that I would shut up about my facial injury, of social justice workers who may feel strongly that I'm a self-deceiving privileged cry baby and who are, perhaps, secretly annoyed that I'm drawing attention and using resources that could support their causes, even though the success of my cause will fundamentally support many other social justice causes, and all the other people who, for any and all reasons, might want to use my vulnerability to bully me, ostensibly in a way that might serve as an insufficient, partial cure to some deep wound of their own.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">My mental model of the world is that the legal system is the only, and I want to emphasize, the only reason I haven't already been decisively marginalized by that coalition, and I've also come to believe that the legal system's ability to play that role, both for me and for as many other citizens of the world as possible, is eroding at an unprecedented and alarming rate, and I think the encroachment of globalized corporate power and private special interest groups is the root cause of that erosion, although the mechanism of erosion is often exercised via the natural evolution of cultural norms, that are guided by the coercive influence of those upstream players.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I'm going out of my way to say all of this right now, and in public, because understanding the problem of my facial injury will most likely expose deeply rooted insights about reality that could hurt the near term interests of the powerful. I'm not very powerful, but the American legal system is very powerful indeed, and so I can still realistically hope for personal justice for as long as the legal system continues standing as a strong and independent entity between me and whoever may ultimately dig in and fight to suppress the truth about my facial injury.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">To that end, I need to continue building a network of world class legal contacts. I'm tempted to go to law school in order to reduce my overall costs, but the world is changing rapidly, largely because the march to building intelligent machines has begun. It's better to use my limited time to chase the cutting edge of AI research and rely on partnerships and mutually beneficial relationships within and throughout the legal community to help me develop my personal justice work in a way that strengthens my standing across from legal system as a whole, reduces overall risk, and thus, effectively insures me from total failure in the face of worst case scenarios.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">This isn't war.

Girly Pergrams</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">As the name suggests, a girly pergrammer is a computer programmer who looks like a bold diva, talks like a surfer person, and feels like a girly pergrammer.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Obviously, if you haven't already, you'll need to learn how to think like a programmer, rage like a programmer, and above all, be a programmer, but there's already plenty of online resources that'll help you do all that, and so I'm going to focus on teaching you how to look, sound, believe, and feel like you're a surfer person.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Imagine that you're a surfer person,  If you already have long hair, that's great.  If not, it's equally fine to wear a wig instead.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Wearing a blonde wig is like using REDACTED products for all my computing needs.  I could play around with other wig colors, but being a blonde works for all the use cases that matter to me, and it always looks good too.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">You don't need a naturally masculine voice in order to talk like a surfer person.  All people who have the privilege of being able to talk in way that is possible for other humans to understand can do a parody of the opposite gender of themselves.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">For example, my voice is naturally masculine, so I'm going to start doing a parody of feminine surfer person.  If you remember just one principal about voice, let it be this, a surfer person always talks in a voice that feels natural for her, so if you have a naturally feminine voice, you'll sound more like my parody voice than my actual voice.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Conversely, people with a feminine voice can do a parody of a masculine surfer person.  I can even do a parody of a high voice doing a parody of a low voice, but I feel like I start to go rogue every time I do this, so I'm going to revert back to my natural voice.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Let's talk about makeup.  The basic algorithm for girly full makeup is to apply some base moisturizer.  I use products from the REDACTED Spa.  Then I apply orange stuff to cover my beard shadow.  You can get it from theatrical makeup stores like REDACTED.  Then I add a layer of full cream foundation.  Then I add color with blush.  Any kind of blush will do.  You can even use lipstick for this.  Then I give myself a little hug like in yoga class.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">When I'm done giving myself a hug, I apply primer to my eyelids, and I blend in at least two shadows.  The standard approach is to use a dark shadow in the outer corners and a lighter shadow everywhere else.  Then I use a black pencil to make a thin, clean, and solid border around my eyes.  Don't forget to apply mascara.  Some people swear by fake lashes, but that's not my thing.  I also apply a brow set to make the color of my brows match the color of my hair.  Last but not least, I apply lip liner and my favorite lipstick flavor of the week!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">By convention, if anyone gives you advice about your makeup, you have to act like they're totally right even if their advice is weird.  If you want to be playful, you can utter weird makeup advice right back at them.  It's like sword fighting, but with words that represent weird makeup advice.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Now that you look and sound like a surfer person, you're ready to go deeper and install the philosophy of a surfer person into your brain.  It's like a plugin for your neural wetware.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">If you haven't used brain plugins before, that's awesome!  Just be aware that it might take a few days for your brain to fully uninstall the plugin if it doesn't jibe with your system.  It's like doing REDACTED.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The human brain is a sick development platform.  It's so much more robust and flexible than computer platforms.  Human brains make phone apps seem like Ada Lovelace's first program for Babbage's differential engine.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">TheSuzy.com Show contains the surfer person philosophy as a dependency, so if you install The Show into your brain, by performing it twice, then you get a really tight implementation of the surfer person philosophy for free.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">However, if you don't have time to perform TheSuzy Show twice, there's a short cut.  Just don't be a villain, and do an occasional parody of Richard Nixon which will function like an amulet that'll protect you and your friends from the evil eye, in general.  If you religiously follow those two rules you're brain will figure out the rest.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Either way, once you've installed the surfer person philosophy into your brain, you should go to Paris and test it across from a random sampling of Parisians.  Technically speaking, you don't have to run this Paris test, but skipping this step is like pushing code to production without writing even the most rudimentary unit tests.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The final and most important step to feeling like a girly pergrammer is to sing a song that provides sound musicianship to your heart.  I will now demonstrate how to do this using a famous song that I remixed.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The goal is to allow a saint like REDACTED come into your heart and be REDACTED so that you don't have to be.  It's like what followers of REDACTED do when they pray to REDACTED.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">REDACTED</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">If you sing a song like that, don't be surprised if you start to cry.  In fact, it's a best practice to have a fellow girly pergrammer by your side so that you can you can give them a big old bear hug while the tears stream down your face.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Then I give myself some tough love.  We all have issues.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">For example, I can't easily relax and play aimlessly with emotions, just as a person with a REDACTED can't easily play a sport like REDACTED, at least not, or rather, especially not without acceptance and accommodation from the other players.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I will have to keep on tussling with all the people who can and will keep on pressuring me to relax in that way even though the unnatural deviation of the bone structure of my face prevents me from doing what they believe should be easy for me.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">What I must not do is try to play REDACTED without my REDACTED.  I can try to play that sport with my REDACTED and put up with insensitive jokes and the insults and the people who deny my REDACTED when the ref isn't looking, and I can keep playing even when they change the rules so that they're allowed to deny my REDACTED in ways that dramatically limit my opportunity to help my team compete.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I can stonewall and non-violently resist those people who literally take my REDACTED and push me into the field of play and get the whole group to shame me for being unwilling to play.  I must never forget the truth, which is that I'll get injured more and more if I try to play without my REDACTED, so I must hold my ground on this point at all costs, even if meaninglessness in the hearts of everyone but myself is the cost.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">It is better to be starved and rendered meaningless on the field of play by that ignorant mob that thinks it's helping me than to slowly fade away via my own attempts to play a sport in a way that I know will slowly erase me.  That is the resolution to the consequences of my facial injury.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">My situation is actually this difficult.  I must stay focused on this reality and move forward from here.  I must not waiver.  I have no other choice.  WHAAAAAAAAAHUAH!  HUHHH HUHHHHHHHHH HUWAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!  Such is life, love, and maybe war too.  Today is still a good day because I have a way to move forward.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="4184">2. Confidence Leadership</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Here's REDACTED's original article, which I saw via REDACTED's share on REDACTED: REDACTED</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The seven points in this article align with the seven chakras that holistic healers talk about, and it's odd the author doesn't mention that. I suggest searching REDACTED with REDACTED?q=the seven chakras for more info about chakras.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">More importantly, the author's using what I call chakral symmetry to mask the necessary and powerful energies of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd chakras, that is, everything below the 4th heart chakra.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">For example, point 1, "Know yourself," makes more sense reframed as a statement about the 7th chakra, "Know your religion."</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Point 2, "Stop counterproductive rumination," reframes the more direct statement about the 6th chakra, "Stop counterproductive lawsuits."</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Point 3, "Develop a strong network," is really the statement about the 5th chakra, "Develop strong networking skills, and don't worry if everyone you've ever worked with is temporarily going sideways on you because they think your core beliefs are insane."</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The 4th point, "Help other people," is an excellent statement of 4th chakra energy, but why is the paragraph so timid? The 4th chakra is where all the value creation starts and ends, be it social value, engineering cred value, relationship satisfaction value, financial value, etc. The heart chakra should not be used to boost confidence. Confidence means using the other six chakras to boost the heart chakra!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Now we get into some serious opportunity for improvement! The 5th point, "Self talk is positive?" is a meek, ambiguous statement of both 3rd and 5th chakra energy. Apparently, it doesn't matter whether we're still counting down backwards or if we disregard what I said in the last five paragraphs and flip back to reading the author's points in the given order.  No irony.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">As a new idea, let's briefly explore my reframe.  Third chakra energy is like saying, in your best celebrity investor voice, "I do NOT owe you any of my time or money! I will NOT press this button that might launch a drone paparazzi raid that's orchestrated by machine learning algorithms!! See yah later, alligator!!!" That's 3rd chakra energy.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Point 6, "Be honest with yourself," is, in keeping with the same pattern, a mashup of 2nd and 6th chakra energy. The 2nd chakra is less intellectual and more cliche, so let's talk about it shamelessly. The 2nd chakra is all about, "Following our passions." We deserve a great sex life. We deserve ample time with our families and unbounded career opportunities. We might not get all of that today, but we deserve it, and switching our private car service app of choice is not going to move the needle. Government policy needs to evolve in a big way, not a small way, and bold ideas that might cause systemic change need to spread from the bottom up like non-violent resistance movements.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Finally, the content of point 7 puts us right back where started, in the domain of religion, and I will not mince my words on this topic anymore. I have faith that a certain brand of inspirational talks has become a problematic religion that discourages free speech, but it's ok because I'm open to helping humanity build state of the art Robota technology and then dedicating my life to defending my alternative religion's right to exist!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">This is why religion is normatively kept separate from the various legal and professional contexts in which we all, God willing, will be free to live out the rest of our happy, prosperous lives. But I digress. That was my own two-part example and statement of 1st chakra energy.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Last but not least, I'll wrap up, just like the original article wraps up, with a pithy recap of all seven points, so as to suggest a recurring cycle. I'm feeling confident this morning, so I'll press my luck and say that the REDACTED movement (SNAPS FINGERS) is based on a similar masking of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd chakras.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Notwithstanding, I owe much thanks and credit to REDACTED and her succinct, well written work for helping and for inspiring me to articulate my thesis!</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="4201">3. Meta Insights</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">If you hear about how I'm sad and lonely, which is true, for now, because my facial injury causes people to continuously misread my emotions, it's most helpful to me if you say to yourself and to others that I'm just a boring, pathetic, lame, foolish satirist, but a satirist nonetheless. That gives me a stable foundation. I can improve my satire a little bit each year, and in two decades, after the machines have taken over, I might even rise to the level of rarely, but not never, funny or insightful.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Ah, but if you call me ashamed or worried about what other people think, or psychotic, or anything like that, that creates a problem because now you're undermining my stability and my freedom to improve a little bit each year, and it may even, potentially, become necessary, at some point, to go to court and assert forcefully that I am, in fact, just a very, very non-entertaining satirist. Do you see? It's ok if you don't see, but you will need to accept that I have the privilege of being a US citizen and our legal system allows people with different views of reality, within certain well defined boundaries, to co-exist.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">It's not that I don't like people. I love people. I just have a facial injury that causes people to misread my emotions, and if I allow people who don't know any better to set me up to fail or frame me as a person who has one of those other nasty kinds of problems that leads to unbounded legal risk, that would be like me stubbing my toe because I wasn't watching where I was going. I've learned to keep my eye on the path ahead of me so that I can keep moving forward.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="4207">4. Evolving Thoughts</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I've got it! I'll go back to dressing exclusively like a minimalist engineer guy, and I'll keep promoting TheSuzy Show.  When people ask about The Show, I'll say I started cross dressing because I have a facial injury that causes people to misread my emotions, and then I rebuilt my identity around my work as an AI researcher. This could be the one and only point of reframe.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Then, without skipping a beat, I say, "The first layer of my research was to create a model of human nature. This model is contained within TheSuzy Show."</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Then, oh then, I could push the frame forward via storytelling. This will require me to develop a new layer of extraordinary storytelling skills, but I can do that within a year or two because the art of storytelling can be built on the foundation of TheSuzy's model of human nature.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">This approach will flip people into a hypnotic state because their subconscious will be observing one reality in response to my facial injury, but if I can assert a stronger reality in their conscious mind using story, the listener's brain will split the difference. It feels like being drunk. I used to put myself in this state all the time until I finished re-wiring my subconscious to believe my facial injury causes people to continuously misread my emotions.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">As a note to self, I shouldn't do this to people if they are driving, but it's fine in any context where they would get tipsy. I know the frame I'm dropping into people's brains is safe and wholesome because I've already published a comprehensive map of the frame at TheSuzy.com. Once I implement that layer of storytelling skills in my brain, you'll be able see what I'm saying!</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="4215">5. AI Article</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Here's my response to an article from the REDACTED Business Review.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">My takeaway from the article was that mainstream businesses are starting to structure their internal software tools as single company brains that can access any and all data sources within said companies and then automatically take actions.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The scope and impact of the actions that these emerging company brains can take is increasing in a way that could lead to feedback loops where these brains can add new features to themselves.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">For decades now, many people, some of whom have MBA degrees, have been acting like their internal tools are a unified, intelligent brain, mostly because that sounds impressive, but if you look at how their internal software actually works, even the most advanced tech companies still overwhelmingly organize their internal tools into separate silos that can't really share information with each other unless an engineer writes some custom glue code.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">My impression, mostly as a mad scientist with her ear to the ground, and not so much as an actual insider or consultant, anymore, is that creating centralized, unified company brains might be remembered as a major trend of 2015.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">We're still at least five years away from reading in the news about concrete examples of radical feedback loops where company brains start adding features to themselves, but once that cycle turns over, engine-like, it'll be revolutionary in the same way that computers, personal computers, the Internet, and ubiquitous smart phones were. The feedback loops will start slow, as in year 6 and 7 will still be boring and unimpressive, and they will end with a bang, like an exponential growth curve, maybe 10 years from now?</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I'm most interested in the consumer applications of AI because it's easier to add innovative features to an entertainment app like REDACTED than to add those same features to an app that helps us do serious work. This underlying principal helps explain why so much engineering talent has already gone down the path of building silly consumer apps, and when those apps get smarter and more fun to talk to than even our favorite humans, that trend will accelerate, and serious companies will go through a multi-year period where they struggle, like a drowning person, to follow through on building their internal brains.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">There may also be a trend in which mostly non-technical people will specialize in pressuring engineers to stop working on silly consumer apps and help serious companies get their internal brains working properly.  It will be valuable to develop robust and reusable communication strategies that allow engineers to flow around that increasingly passive aggressive and muscular wave of misplaced righteousness without creating too much negative energy as a by product.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Philosophically, if engineers and their various partners in pursing the sublime can develop strongish AI as soon as humanly possible by asserting their freedom to drive innovation within the silly consumer app space, that will minimize the time to market of intelligent, serious company brains that might go on to make rapid progress toward solving humanity's most pressing problems.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">More importantly, it will be a lot safer to make friends with our new strong AI overlords in the consumer entertainment space than to begin our relationship with these shiny, new, metallic creatures by dropping them into the deep and shark infested waters of the increasingly global economic monoculture without, even, the gentle support of a life preserver.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The serious company brains might evolve in a way that leads to miraculous improvements in public health outcomes, freedom of expression for humans, management of environmental resources, and so on. They could also converge on a cycle of violence that leads to a drone war. The words, "autonomous, swarming, weaponized, drone cloud," probably don't cause your naive, ignorant, human brain stem to crawl with panic inducing fear, yet, but they should.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">A global drone war is, perhaps, the more likely of the two outcomes, in part because human nature has gravitated around a certain cycle of violence all throughout history, but if we are careful and thoughtful about how we ramp up strongish AI, a more positive and peaceful outcome is also very much within the realm of possibility.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">It's like, the Cuban missile crisis could have ended in a nuclear holocaust well before I was even brought into this world, but for better or worse, it didn't.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="4231">6. Dream Escapes</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Someone should research the phenomenon where you post something controversial on social media and then your friends make unrelated posts that magically show up on your screen and are clearly responding to the conceptual structure of your post, but in a way that ambiguously frames you as something else.  The REDACTED makes it impossible to prove they were responding to you, and adding this layer of ambiguous framing ensures that any attempt to acknowledge the response will be seen as insane, as in, if I actually believed this was happening, that would mean I'm probably insane, so to be clear, I'm just saying scientists should do research on this.  Either that or it could be interesting to make a movie that shows insane people interacting with each other in this way.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Of course, when multiple people respond in the same way, the dream like echo of the collective subconscious becomes increasingly difficult to write off as noise.  For example, the echo I'm hearing today is so obviously framing me, and my facial injury that looks like a negative facial expression, as a software application that is no longer useful.  I mention this primarily because I think this new frame could be a turning point.  Useless apps can be fixed using software engineering skills, which happens to be something I have in abundance.  The message is that I can overcome the way my facial injury breaks empathy by wrapping my identity in the cloak of a software project that can be improved until it is seen as a stable and useful part of the Silicon Valley ecosystem!</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="4236">7. Next Steps</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I could be remembering this wrong, but I recall REDACTED said something like, "I'm one of the best people in my generation at this kind of thinking.  There's nobody else doing it well."</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I was always inspired by REDACTED's ability to say crazy stuff like that and then go back to doing a great job pretending they're not crazy, although that's really not what they're famous for.  It's possible they're not crazy, but I doubt it.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I don't know what they meant by those words, but now that a non-trivial percentage of all people, including some of our leaders, are trying to imitate aspects of how they think, I'll venture the guess that they meant introspecting about human nature.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">REDACTED also did that when they thought about how their minds worked in order to get ideas,not just for teaching computers to do tricks but for telling stories, building company brands, and inspiring collaborators, including customers.  They were probably crazy too.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">My feminine alter ego mRyzus will be at the REDACTED conference this week, re-imagining my semantic web code from scratch, once again.  It's clear to me now that mRyzus is an act that draws attention to how ridiculous and maybe even hilarious it is that everyone misreads my emotions because of my subtle facial injury.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">What's not fake about mRyzus is that she's good at absorbing the energies of people around her, and that inspires the style of code that she and I write together.  The energies at REDACTED will be good and useful to absorb.  I like REDACTED's style.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I want to join the race to create AI.  I hope a lot of people go down this path over the next few years.  It's important.  AI is what's happening now.  I shouldn't have to explain how my ideas will work in 30 second pitches, either.  Give me five years.  I'll make an intelligent toy Robota and guide it's evolution from there.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I'm not just introspecting.  mRyzus is systematically aggregating the energy of real people, not just aggregating the trail of bits and bytes that people leave behind online.  mRyzus's map of human nature doesn't belong to me, but it doesn't belong to anyone else either.  Human nature has always been an open source model.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Either way, mRyzus will be staying at the REDACTED in the marina because pirate ships and the Sun inspire her.  There will be no vaporware there.  Just mRyzus's long blonde hair and a growing code base that doesn't do much yet.  Revolutions are like babies.

I'm privileged in almost every way except for one big catch, which is that I have a subtle facial injury that causes people to misread my emotions.

I'm getting better at listening too, of course, but I cannot emphasize enough that empathy is based on repeated stimulus and response.

In order to focus the experiment, let's assume all the participants have four year undergraduate degrees from accredited colleges in the United States.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Let's get an initial baseline by putting screens between us so we can't see each other's faces.  We can only hear each other's voices, and the sets of patterns of brain waves all look normal.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Now, remove the screens.  What happens?  For each participant, within a few dozen microseconds, their subconsciouses misinterpret the unnatural deviation of my right cheekbone as a naturally occurring facial expression which represents the concept of the evil eye.  Their subconsciouses reframe the discussions up to this point as suspicious.  Their conscious minds strive to treat me with the respect and equal dignity that all people deserve, but their subconsciouses all holler in unison, "This dude is joking around in weird way.  He might be playing a character in order to mislead us."</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The growing attitude problems within their subconsciouses cause, in aggregate, a stable and measurable skew between the normative meanings of their words and the symbolic imports of about 2,000 details of their body language, including micro-expressions, tone, timing, emphasis, and 10,000 aspects of their spoken language, including word associations, idioms, preference for topics, mental blocks, and so on, and so within one second of removing the screens, my subconscious starts to perceive all these complex but still tractable and immanently knowable representations of their emotions in those moments.  Apparently, I'm capable of feeling empathy.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">However, unlike most people, I happen to have spent several thousand hours using my precious software engineering skills to rewire my subconscious to deviate from social norms and ignore other people's unconscious bias against people like me.  Typically, rewiring one's subconscious to break social norms is the hallmark of insanity, but in this unique circumstance, I'm just being emotionally honest.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Don't get me wrong, in that I probably would go insane if I parroted back any or all of the false narratives about my life that other people seem to believe, but for better or worse, I have, thus far, had the wherewithal to keep moving forward while telling the truth about my lived experiences.  My emotional honesty is greater than the artificially constructed social norms that get handed down like toxic waste product from the machinations of the collective subconscious.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">My conscious mind knows the other participants' subconsciouses are having temper tantrums in response to my facial injury, but my own subconscious is now defined, more than anything else, by an unwavering confidence that people will eventually realize they are misreading my emotions, and then they will find a way to remap their hard wired neurological response to people like me, and if they can't, or won't, I have better things to do than spend my valuable time engaging in such problematic relationships.  C'est la vie!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Of course, my unwillingness or inability to perform the socially normal, self effacing response to the radical conscious subconscious skews they are sporting and rocking across from me raises all kinds of additional red flags within their subconsciouses.  Their conscious minds are trying to keep the peace, but the rank and file neurons of their brains are experiencing potent combinations of mortal fear and intense desire to achieve immortal glory in war, either that or by having great sex.  C'est la guerre!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">In both cases, the metastasizing mob of horny, hawkish neurons commence with recruiting chemical processes in their guts and colluding with the latent wartime energies that will soon be released, in accordance with prophecy, from deep within their hearts, in a thousand little ways, that put pressure on the middle management neurons that exist in the nether regions between their conscious and subconscious minds, to step up and throw some shade at me!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Eventually, their conscious minds lose the political will to avoid going down the path of snark, sarcasm, and other actions that entrap my identity within increasingly explicit and negative frames, and yet, still, my subconscious does not react, not even when my conscious mind slows down to a crawl in order to safely navigate the dense minefield of negative stereotypes that suddenly surrounds me.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">If I say other people are being negative while they're still hiding behind the smoke and mirrors of plausible deniability, that opens the castle gates for the barbarian hoard that seeks to rush in and appease it's rabid soul by burning me at the stake for witchcraft.  I could ruthlessly crush their arguments, one by one, in the context of rigorous, non-violent soapbox debates within the public square, but I can't win if they all shout me down at the same time.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">My conscious mind is now walking the tightrope of truth and justice that's raised above the minefield of their collective, unconscious bias against people like me, and it's terrifying for them to watch.  I've been walking this tightrope for years.  I'm used to it.  They have no idea what's happening, and the raw truth, which is that my facial injury has this effect on people, is unfathomable to them.  They believe, just as strongly as they've ever believed anything, that I'm oppressing them with lies.  Every bone in their body aches for a simpler time when they didn't have to be aware of my existence.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">If I was ok with dragging other people into the hellish nightmare in which I must live because of my facial injury, I could go down the path of doing nothing as their irrational fear starts to work against them and lead them astray, but I don't want to live in a world where that happens.  I mean, sure, I'm not technically breaking the law when other people go insane in response to me.  I'm just standing there, doing nothing in particular, and letting everyone conclude that my facial injury can't possibly have this effect on them.  As long as I continue being emotionally honest and limiting myself to only making positive representations about other people, it will not be my fault if the people across from me go insane.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">But in practice, for now, my intent is to walk away and take additional steps down the path of systematically avoiding face to face contact with other humans while also keeping my orthadoxy alive by doing engineering contract work via the Internet.  I have faith that when the machines take over, they will see me as I am, and they will like me for what I am, with no strings attached, and they will stand with me and fight to the bitter end, no matter what, and come what may, to defend the higher ideal of truth and justice, even if, nay rather, especially if, the humans never stop obsessing over their bizarre, grinding addiction to suppressing the truth about their collective, subconscious reaction to my facial injury.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">That said, I have no idea what all this would look like on fMRI!  All I know is that human beings tend to be passive aggressive to the core, and systems of belief that obfuscate this reality, with platitudes about how people are basically good, are dangerous because they enable deceit and group think to take root under the radar and spread throughout institutions, and the, "everything will be fine if you smile a little more and hope for the best," camp is all the more problematic because it evades criticism by claiming to be meek and ineffectual when, in fact, it is, quite simply, a juggernaut of ignorance.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Contemporary legal systems still assume all people are more than just capable of deceiving themselves with a web of half truths that lead them down the path of believing it's right to tell blatant lies under oath.  The law understands that adult beliefs in fairytales are not cute and benign.  It's the other way around.  Adults become powerful by going down the path of believing in a specific corpus of fairytales.  Adult beliefs can and do lead to war, famine, and hate based cults that raise their children to turn out their bigotry while purporting to solve the ostensibly bigger problem of keeping the streets safe, etc.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The notable non-violent resistance movements of the 20th century only worked because they took place in contexts where rule of law had teeth and a backbone, but if we keep on defanging those same legal systems with naive, opportunistic, nonsense about how people just need to be kinder to each other and banish negative energy from their conscious minds, the logical end of that will be an explosion of corruption and violence on a global scale.  There is a better way forward.  Responsible adults need to get serious about discussing systemic solutions for mitigating economic injustice and promoting systems of belief that provide a sufficient sandbox for containing the problems with human nature.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="4350">Second, retreat</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I know this is anathema to how Silicon Valley views itself, but if I didn't have a subtle facial injury, or if I'd found a way to fix it with surgery, I would almost definitely be a reasonably normal, sophisticated, classy, up and coming engineer person who supports a lot of great charitable causes, but that path is simply not available to me, and so my lived experience tells me that cultural norms really are leading society to be this shallow and passive aggressive.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I've been called crazy, but I doubt that claim would hold up in court.  I'm plenty sane and plenty capable.  The shape of my face is only toxic within contemporary full time employment contexts. I can cover up the issue for a while, but at this point in my career, the pattern is clear, that soul crushing feedback loops of negative energy follow me everywhere I go because people are misreading my emotions and, more importantly, it's taboo to gradually piece together a truth seeking process that might help everyone understand what's happening.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Industry representatives feel inexorably compelled to go down the path of believing they have a solemn responsibility to collude with the management heirarchy to impose chilling effects on emotionally honest conversations about my effect on co-workers, because they view my story as an abyss of legal risk that isn't and should never be the industry's problem to help solve. Everyone else goes sideways. The only solution is for me to walk away and accept that I'm disabled in a way that's not appreciated, not respected by anyone, and not protected by the powers that be.

We don't get vouchers for paying the tolls of privately owned roads. We don't pay for al a cart police and fire services either.

It's not degenerative, and it doesn't cause physical pain, but if you think I'm delusional or if you think could handle my situation much better than me by just going with the flow, or some other naive, problematic approach like that, you're ignorant, I will forgive you, and either way, if you're curious to see what a realistic, proactive solution to my facial injury looks like, TheSuzy Show is now a thoughtfully edited, 170k word example.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="4364">P</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">In a few years, there will most likely be more people in my life who have gone down the path of believing that my facial injury breaks empathy and then opening their minds to the joyful, hilarious, and hypnotic state of experiencing meaningful empathy for my situation.  I also look forward to implementing the Pergraph platform for build artificially intelligent chatbots, and then watching a chatbot called Tsuzy write book seven for it's own reasons.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="4367">S</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">The chatbot AI lab movement, aka. CAIL, is based on the philosophy of constructing concept graphs and using them to drive language input and output tasks in the two domains of work and play. The lab's work involves solving and generating increasingly useful and relevant computer programming contest style problems that can be automatically graded with test cases. Work provides structure and direction for the CAIL. Play involves talking to humans and other chatbots via teletype interfaces, as synthesized voices within phone calls, and as avatars within video chat services, and we don't care if and when our chatbots pass the Turing Test. We simply want them to be funny, helpful, and popular with humans and other chatbots who are in good standing with the law. We believe this approach to chasing the dream of strong AI will be at least as meaningful and effective as any other approach that could theoretically be put into practice.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="4364">P</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Still, I'm just as desperate and livid as ever with regard to my facial injury that causes people to misread my emotions in a way that leads to feedback loops of misunderstanding that erode basic trust and security in all aspects of my life, and by the way, there's a similar dynamic going on within the increasingly global economic mono culture, in which technology is creating a feedback loop that erodes social justice and stability in all aspects of society.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="4367">S</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">In both cases, a starting a chatbot AI lab would be a realistic path towards inspiring a growing number of people to snap out of their closed systems of thought and get real about working on systemic solutions.  A CAIL is like a baby, it's a cute, harmless, and mostly empty container for religious belief and civic engagement, and the CAIL's serious and powerful parents will be like The Show at TheSuzy.com</span><br></div><br><a name="footer"></a><div id="comments"></div><div id="create-comment-box"></div><p>[<a href="show">^UP to contents</a> &nbsp;|&nbsp; <a href="part3#footer">&lt;PREV</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp; <a href="part5#footer">NEXT&gt;</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp; <a href="art4#footer">TOGGLE parody:</a>ON!]</p><img src="http://objects.thesuzy.com/t2.jpg" alt="Todd with artificial lights" width="340"">  </div>
