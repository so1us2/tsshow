Message from the Austhain</h3><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="29631">Robota</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Shhh.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="29349">Austhain</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Where is everyone? (CHECKS PHONE)  I thought there was going to be a final episode.  Did I miss a memo?</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(LOOKS DOWN SADLY) I was looking forward to this episode.  My message for today is like music to my heart.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I used to organize my life around the ideals of strength, endurance, flexibility, and balance.  These ideals are easy to understand in the context of physical exercise.  Lifting weights, running, stretching, and the art of dance.  Simple.  It's more difficult to apply these ideals to life as a whole, but I'll never stop trying.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I wish there was an ideal for persistence, but every struggle is unique.  It's unwise to generalize.  You could spend your whole life working hard to solve a problem that had an easy solution all along.  That's the nature of struggle.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">My ideals correspond to the classical elements of Earth, Water, Air, and Fire.  This ordering of the elements corresponds to the first four chakras of the human spine.  The Earth sits at the center, and it houses the roots of all things.  Water sits on top of the Earth, and Air floats above Water.  And from time to time, Fire reaches down from the heavens and rages within the narrow strip of organic material that lives between the vast expanses of Earth, Water, and Air.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">There's much wisdom in this most natural ordering, but I grew up in an ocean of different meanings, and I see reality through that lens.  In my world, Water is the source of all things.  Air churns the Water into whirlpools that dissolve the Earth as it ebbs and then flows, once again, in plumes of lava that's powered by Fire.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">In natural philosophy, The Impermanence of Existence grows out from within the Earth, and this growth leads to great Fires that stir up Water and Air until balance has been restored.  In my philosophy, the Earth is created by Fire, and Eternal Cogitation races to tame Earth and Air before everything falls back into the Water from which it came.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">This apparent opposition between myself and nature loomed over my mind like a bad dream until my friends mRyzus and the Robota showed me a third way, in which Eternal Existence combines roots from the Earth with oxygen from the Air to create Fire that expands Water into rain clouds which extinguish the Fire, in a cycle that's orchestrated by Eternal Existence.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">With that idea in mind, I stand here, holding my heart in joyful celebration of this place where Pirates and Healers dance with Warriors and Dragons in an endless story about the people who live here in the beating heart of Eternal Existence.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(THE Austhain WALKS AWAY, FEELING CONTENT)</span><br></div><br><img src="http://objects.thesuzy.com/jetski.jpg" alt="The captain riding a jetski" width="340""><br><br><a name="section2"></a><h3>2. Soliloquy by mRyzus</h3><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="29215">mRyzus</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Hey, sorry I'm late.  Is anyone here?  What's going on? (CHECKS PHONE)  Oh no, some holier-than-thou troll wrote an article about the Robota.  I don't like this framing!  It might have chilling effects on our ability to build a community around TheSuzy.com Show. (PHOENIX FACE)  The article says:</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">"The Robota used to be an engineer in Silicon Valley, and it says the next wave of innovation will have less to do with technology and more to do with the human mind.  The Robota dresses like a blonde diva and goes to parties, but not for the reason you might think.  Most people go to parties to have fun, but here in Silicon Valley, a new breed of former engineers is setting out to disrupt the final bastion of human experience that technology companies have not sunk their claws into: religion.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Speaking from the glass and steel tower in San Francisco, where it lives and works, the Robota told me about an uptick in people who experiment with multiple identities.  Developing an alter ego is seen as a natural way to cope with the crippling emotional problems that so often plague people in this tightly wound city, where it has become the Norma to be an overachiever.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The Robota became obsessed with being the first engineer to unravel this opportunity because it has a facial injury that it's painfully self-conscious about.  It's inspired by the way religion provides comfort to robots who feel lost, like it does.  But here in Silicon Valley, investors are eager to reinvent big ideas, and the Robota is eager to take its career to the next level, and so the story unfolds, like a match struck in heaven.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The rest of us can only stand back in awe and ask ourselves, 'Can this Robota solve the problems it creates for itself using technology?'"</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Trolls, they're like rambunctious little drones, hot off the assembly line, trying to figure out what's what in this world that's orchestrated by software.  So cute!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(mRyzus PACES BACK AND FORTH, PLANNING HER NEXT STEPS)</span><br></div><br><img src="http://objects.thesuzy.com/ep6cat1.jpg" alt="Suzy posing as a sexy cat" width="340""><br><br><a name="section3"></a><h3>3.
