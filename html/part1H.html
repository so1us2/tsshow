I hosted a feminist slumber party last night and we talked about how big media creates self-serving myths.  My BFF convinced me to exercise more in order to maximize the number of brain cycles in my life.  I'm at a party in SoCal, and hot people are coding naked in the master bedroom.  Every diva needs a fave algorithm.  Mine is the CYK dynamic programming chart parser.  What's yours?  Why do hipsters like it when I pretend to be a nice person pretending to be a mean person pretending to be a nice person?  Searching the Internet for images for the search term "fashion" is not bad.

I thought it was a scam, but the guy had a way with words, so I called up my buddies and we played credit card roulette to figure out who would go in first.  The loser went in, and all we could hear was loud music.  We were cringing and trying to play it cool.  Nobody wanted to be that person who suggests we check if everything's ok.

She's putting together a team, and she has to resolve drama within the team.  Their goal is to create a movie about SunsetSuzy.  This is very meta.  It's a nod to her roots in Silicon Valley.

The joint is wholesome and eclectic in a way that would never make money as a franchise.  SSusan talks about when she was an assistant teacher and she observed a student who was trying to create a 2D srobot on paper during a 3D srobot building class.

He founded the first British colony in America.  That colony failed fast because the supply ships went on detours to steal gold from Spanish treasure ships, and then, after personally leading an expedition to South America to steal gold from Spanish outposts, Raleigh wrote a book that contributed to the legend of El Dorado.

To make this work for science fiction fans, historical events should play out the same way because the rise of Christianity overshadows Hadrian's social movement.  After the fall of Rome, people will remember Hadrian was a cross dresser, but their actions will not be influenced by their new memories.  Religion has the power to define the cultural frame so completely that there are no side effects between eras with different religious frames.

Also, Shakespeare saw the court of King Arthur as a pivot point in which the memory of Hadrian's movement is re-imagined within English culture, but now that SSuzy's telling her about the world 500 years into the future, Shakespeare loves the idea of defining herself as a second pivot point in which the the deep philosophy of cross dressing is re-imagined for the enlightenment era.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="30539">FDirector</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">If the crew goes to ancient Rome and encourages folks to cross dress, Shakespeare can convince the show boating Raleigh to cross dress.

Boom.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="30567">FCommando</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Yes!  They should start at the court of the Emperor Titus and his scribe Josephus.  mRyzus hypnotizes the SRobot and summons Jesus, but they get God instead.
