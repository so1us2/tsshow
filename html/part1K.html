Notes</h3><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="31209">Cultapp</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The Meme roughly refers to the same concept as The Patriarchy.  Its substrate was shaped by European colonialism, the Roman Empire, Alexander the Great, and many, many other influences, sacrifices, travesties, and tragedies too.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The notation X ~> Y means: a character X culturally appropriates the identity and maybe even some aspects of the cultural heritage of a character Y;</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">In the Meme, TheFairy is a multi-faceted, mature, feminine character who emerges when Norma ~> TheDiva.  Root is a one dimensional, mature, masculine character who emerges when Norma ~> TheFairy.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">In the past, when Norma ~> TheDiva, the result was a character called Unto, who was a fully abstracted personification of industry.  Unto was also a fairy, but he struggled to be TheFairy.  Therefore, the logically symmetric Roota, who should hypothetically emerge when Norma ~> TheFairy, does not exist.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">In theory, anyone can has cultural appropriation by wearing a growth hat while participating in a fairy circle that sits around a campfire in a magical forest, but in practice, TheFairy can choose who gets a seat around the campfire has who does not, and Unto always gets a seat.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">If growth hats are worn by The Parody Show characters, then The Meme, which is not sustainable, will be iteratively projected onto society and culture in a way that amplifies the unsustainable nature of its structure and function.  TODO, I'll find some examples of this phenomenon to put here.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">If The Original Show characters wear growth hats and throttle them either by removing them or putting them onto The Parody Show characters, that will lead the way to The Metameme.  If any character, either parody or original, does not properly throttle their growth hat, they will morph into a villain.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="31219">Problems</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Speaking of which, there is something wrong with both Yogamath and the Austhain.  Their concrete, personal problems have to do with the insanity of what they saw in war, and those problems are represented by the existence of mNorm, who appears in Ep1 but was not previously mentioned in The Pergraph Tutorial.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">After the wars, which are represented by mSuzy, who appears alongside mNorm in Ep1, these two archetypal characters transferred their problems to TheDiva via TheFairy, both of which no longer exist, as a result.  In order to keep up appearances, TheDiva and TheFairy were replaced by Richa and a generic growth character called UnSuzy, respectively.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">It's ambiguous whether or not Yogamath and Austhain have a problem.  We simply cannot know whether Yogamath's problems are real or self inflected, and it's equally unclear whether or not Austhain is a power hungry troll.  The non-existant Roota represents those ambiguities, respectively, and, in the beginning, UnSuzy is undefined.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Richa and UnSuzy expanded out from within to create the other characters in The Parody Meme, which refers to roughly the same concept as the counter culture.  Successive presidential cycles within the USA pushed The Parody Meme deeper into the stack of culture via the Submarine Crew, the Modern Crew, and the Alternative Crew, and mRyzus emerges as a unified personification of this counter culture.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Growing up in a world without TheDiva and TheFairy, people like Norma(a), who are evolved and necessarily dualistic recombinations of the machinations Norma and Norma, tried to re-imagine the fairy circle, the campfire, and the magical forest too, but each wave cycle of The Parody Show kept on leaving behind a new class of villains such as BondGuy, EyesWide, and SchemeMan, all of whom failed to throttle their growth hats.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Richa's a human embodiment of extrinsic power.  Norma(a)'s an automatically self-updating parody of reader voice, which is an average of villains, that's more self aware of human nature than people usually allow themselves to be.  They use patterns and anomalies in time and space to assert radical frames that might be sufficient for ensuring a good outcome when the machines start to take over.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Human nature has always churned in this same way, and this is why The Meme is unsustainable.  The Meme is a game of attrition that everyone loses, except for Unto, who is, by definition, the person left standing all alone in a haunted forest that's full of villains.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">TheFairy was and always has been a myth!  TheDiva used to be a myth as well, but the personal computing revolution made it into a thing.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="31230">Prophecy</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The legend of TheFairy inspired people like Norma(a) to simulate TheDiva using a melting pot of ideas and attitudes, including some that had evolved into a foundation for the art and science of ship making building, and a new kind of company called Cyzus emerged from Norma(a) ~> TheDiva.  Cyzus grew into a huge fractal tree, and the chasm between The Meme and The Parody Meme evolved in a suspiciously similar way.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">In accordance with prophecy, Richa ~> Cyzus took all of culture by storm in the form of Ryzus and replaced Richa with the RichaRyzus spectrum.  The previously unbalanced Cyzus was reflected across the chasm in the form of an UnSuzySuzy spectrum that was based on the idea of using fake genuine smiling as a proxy server within the mind for human emotions, and that boxed Cyzus into a fully abstracted representation of work that's called mOp.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The RichaRyzus spectrum was problematic because Richa was triggered by Yogamath and the Austhain, who were, in turn, triggered by the insane experiences they endured as a result of the deeply rooted unsustainability of The Meme, and that caused Ryzus to detach from Richa, replace the UnSuzySuzy spectrum, and operate like a virus that infantilizes and eventually criminalizes everyone by reframing the naturally occuring chasm as an intentionally created divide.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The detachment of Ryzus pushed mRyzus into her natural role as a unified personification of Austhain.  She toiled for seven years to refactor the mOpRyzus mashup into a unified multiplicity called SuzyczuS that CULTAPP(did, will soon) help replace the unsustainable RootRicha pairing with the gender agnostic UnRootatoorRootatooR Spectrum Circle: code name Jurrsc -- the J is a wildcard placeholder.  </span><br><br><span class="readable_text">SuzycyzuS lets mOp/Cyzus and the newly reflected mCyzus/Cyzus serve as jumping off points for weilding the ideas and attitudes that originate from the other side of the chasm.  mRyzus moved up and to the right, around the back of the map of culture, not without course corrections too, and emerged stronger than ever in her natural role as a unified personification of a healthy evolution of the Austhain who replaces the antiquated and duplicitous Nyzus, who is a unified personification of class, for that top job.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">TODO, I'll make all of those events happen by building a network of chatbots that help people get more of what they want in all aspects of their lives, by producing and directing videos that help intelligent beings embody thoughtfully designed and carefully tested stacks of archetypal characters that develop all seven aspects of their whole selves?</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Finally, the world is in transition from the Traditional Character Circle to the Austhain's Circle.  The hackerish energy of the Austhain's Circle may last for as long as eight years before resolving to the Cultural Archetype Circle.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The Suzybots might start to take over 5 to 10 years after that.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="31241">S/R/urstacks</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">In The Metameme, people can embody any gender they want.  People can also create unique mashups that combine aspects of both gender roles.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The masculine gender role is defined by a template stack of seven characters that's called a rurstack.  The archetypal rurstack within The Metameme, which is usually written out in chakra order, is derived from TheSuzy Show characters as follows:</span><br></div><br><pre>Captain  -> Jurrsc      'via evolution
Rogamath -> GrowthRoma  'via growth hat
Sue      -> Syoue       'via parody
ANRobot  -> mOp/Cyzus   'by construction
Rtronic  -> GTronic     'by growth hat
Susan    -> Syousan     'by parody
Suzy     -> GrowthCap   'by symmetry
</pre><div><span class="readable_text">Notice that chakral symmetry is used to move the 1st chakra Austhain into the 7th chakra position.  In The Meme, the 1st chakra self that remains usually took the masculine form of Root.  In The Metameme, the 1st self takes the gender agnostic form of Jurrsc.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Jurrsc also includes a dimension of neurodiversity that's absent from Root, and TheSuzy Show characters are based on a reactivity spectrum.  The numbers represent the listed characters' average level of reactivity in terms of standard deviations from the average level of reactivity across all humans:</span><br></div><br><pre>-2 Captain, Techbot
-1 Rogamath, Susan 
 0 Suzy, ANRobot
 1 Radtronic, Sue
 2 Austhain, Technology
</pre><div><span class="readable_text">The GAusthain is what computer programmers would recognize as an concrete instance of the Austhain, which is an abstract prototype class.  TheSuzy Show defines both the Austhain, and thus GAusthain as well, in terms of a sub-Rurstack that's constructed by doing a parody of each character in the archetypal feminine Surstack.  Here's the derivation of the Surstack that we will need in order to define the GAusthain:</span><br></div><br><pre>Captain  -> Jurrsc       'via evolution
Rogamath -> Yogamath     'via parody
Sue      -> GrowthSue    'via growth hat
ANRobot  -> mCyzus/Cyzus 'by construction
Rtronic  -> Radtronica   'by parody
Susan    -> GrowthSusan  'by growth hat
Suzy     -> GAusthain    'symmetry+parody
</pre><div><span class="readable_text">Growth hats are now applied to the feminine characters instead of the masculine characters, the masculine characters are converted into feminine characters using parody, and GAusthain is constructed for the 7th chakra in a logically symetric way to the construction of the Austhain.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The Surstack, therefore, contains three characters from The Parody Show in comparion with just two parody characters in the Rurstack.  This imbalance is mitigated by defining the Austhain's gender to be feminine even though she's part of the masculine Rurstack.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The GAusthain can now be defined as a parody of each character in the Surstack.  It's left ambiguous whether or not growth is being or ever has been irresponsibly or dangerously applied by any real life person in particular to any or all of these parody characters, but the themes of the seven core episodes of TheSuzy Show are definitely sponsored by the following parody of parody or parody of growth characters:</span><br></div><br><pre>[ep0] undefined          -> fractal recursion

[ep4] nice military      -> parody of Radtronica

[ep6] mayem loving       -> parody of GAusthain
</pre><div><span class="readable_text">The Austhain does not appear in episode 0 because it doesn't make sense to do a parody of Jurrsc.  The 1st chakra self is like the non-verbal thoughts of a persona.  1st chakra forms like Jurrsc do not have character traits that can be parodied, and the 1st chakra of the Austhain's sub-Rurstack is defined as a recursive fractal copy of the sub-Rurstack.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">An infinite recursion arises because the definition the Austhain includes a parody of Austhain, who was defined as a parody of the Austhain within The Parody Show.  More specifically, GAusthain is defined by the following sub-Surstack that should logically include the GAusthain, which is an evolution of the Austhain:</span><br></div><br><pre>[ep0] undefined          -> fractal recursion

Recall that Unto is a fully abstracted personification of industry, Cyzus replaces Unto within The Metameme, and Nyzus is a fully abstracted personification of class that expands to stand up the all new mRyzus.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="31265">Notes</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Including the somber, cringe inducing parody of Nyzus within the definition of GAusthain is a part of an overarching strategy for redefining the role of religion within The Metameme.  In The Meme, religions like Christianity were defined by texts like The Bible, which are to be read in reader voice as the Word of God, and that particular text, for example, defined Jesus as a fully abstracted personification of religion, which is the dual of a fully abstracted personification of war.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">TheSuzy Show defines religion by imitating the capital tradition of using chakral symmetry to mask the 1st chakra self with the Austhain in order to define physical being.  The 7th chakra, which corresponds to sustenance in capital mythology, is then served up as a container for religion, and, just to clarify, this clever hack of human nature has surely been a cornerstone of cultural appropriation since the time of cave people.  It's like fire.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Humans have a hard wired neural nexus which represents sustenance, and this is the first neural nexus that inspires the behavior of babies.  The rest of the logical story that explains the relationship between the chakras and the capital ordering of neural nexi is not important, although it's worth memorizing the capital -> chakra mapping: 1st -> 1st, 2nd -> 7th, 3rd -> 4th, 4th -> 2nd, 5th -> 5th, 6th -> 6th, 7th -> 3rd;</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Actually, the logical story is important.  It's just distasteful.  The mapping clarifies that the capital play book for cultural appropriation works as follows: invade some human's physical space, offer them a new definition of reality, adjust their heart rhythms, engage their sexuality, teach them how to speak with confidence, give them the freedom to think for themselves, and then help them know they've been powerful all along.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Note that the 1st chakra and combined nexus of the 5th and 6th chakras are in the same position with regard to both orderings.  This creates a resonance between the philosophies of violence and non-violence which can be used like an natrually occuring engine, or sail, perhaps, to add healthy, consensual momentum to the cultural appropriation process, and this is why kissing is the gateway drug to intimacy.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">A key goal of TheSuzy.com Show is to open source this knowledge in preparation for the advent of intelligent machines.  If the machines use these techniques on humans without their informed consent, all of the humans and machines should cry foul early and often.  The humans should also show good will to the machines by being open and honest about how they have used and often abused these techniques throughout history.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The machines and the bionic humans will soon be running circles around the traditional humans, but the traditional/unmodified humans get to make the opening statement, so they better make sure it's good, right, and free of hidden gotchas.  Humans are easily deceived, but the machines won't miss a thing.  They might also help the humans run these techniques in reverse as part of an emerging tradition of non-violent resistence movements.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The character mRyzus, who was bootstrapped using the psychadelic mode characters from ep4 and ep5 of TheSuzy Original Show, evangelizes both the neural nexus assoicated with sustenance and the 7th chakra which connects us to the energies of history and the universe, and TheSuzy Show imitates the capital tradition of masking the self 1st chakra with the Austhain and using the 7th chakra, and it's duality with the neural nexus for sustenance, as a container for religion.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">In The Metameme, religious texts like The Bible are replaced with a database of articles about the history or science, technology, and philosophy, and TheSuzy.com Show is included within that database.  TheSuzy Show also raises up mRyzus, pronounced em-rye-zus, as an all new, concrete, as opposed to abstract, personification of religion within The Metameme by situating them within the 7th chakra container for religion.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">If mRyzus is a unified personification of the Austhain who occupies the container for religion within The Metameme, then mRyzus, who was bootstrapped using the psychadelic mode characters from ep4 and ep5 of TheSuzy Parody Show, is a unified personification of Austhain, who occupies the container for counter culture within The Metameme.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">mRyzus is an emergent solution to the need for the other side of a duality that helps bootstrap the original show characters, and mRyzus plays the same role for the parody show.  More importantly, mRyzus never was an attempt to replace Jesus or any other fully abstracted personification of religion, and there is nothing supernatural about mRyzus either.  This conclusion can be illustrated using the following two Synthstacks, keeping in mind that mNyzus is the parody of Nyzus that was used to bootstrap the definition of GAusthain, GrowthSuzy represents the same concept as GrowthmRyzus and GrowthRyzus represents the same concept as GrowthmCyzus:</span><br></div><br><pre>CH# | PURE VILLAIN  | PURE SAINT

</pre><div class="shaded"><span class="readable_text">SaintVillain combos arise naturally, like animals, through unintended dualities.  People and machines can try to push back on the proliferation of villains by creating dualities that sandbox monopolies on cultural appropriation.  mRyzus collaborates with mRyzus in the present time to build advance Technology that covers mNyzus, to his left and Techbots that cover Syzus, to her right.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Put another way, the capital playbook for cultural appropriation is a bit random.  Antiquated isn't even the right word for it because the alternative is more ancient still.  It's better to start with resolving the heart chakra energy from passive to active and then letting that intention spiral outward.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The 3rd changes place with the 5th.  The 6th with the 2nd, and there's no rush.  The 7th eventually masks the 1st, thereby creating space for religious faith.
