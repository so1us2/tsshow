Our guest for today is an artificial intelligence researcher named Auth who also happens to be the author of TheSuzy.com Show.  He's creating software that imitates me, and I can't wait to learn all about it!  Hey Auth!</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="8197">Auth</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Hi Suzy!

We should start with a duality.  (SPINS) The archetypal dual is breath in vs. breath out.

(POINTS TO THE DUAL-CUBE) You're the blue cube on the outside, and I'm the purple octahedron defined by drawing lines between the centroids of each face of the cube.  Culture is designed by humans, and it's imperfect.  The dual-cube arises naturally from the deep logic of the universe, and it's perfect.  Maybe there's a God who wanted math to work out this way, or maybe God is a pink containing sphere for a dual-cube.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="8197">Auth</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">(COMEDIAN) If we draw a second sphere inside the cube and a third sphere inside the octahedron, God can be a triplet of all three spheres.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="8181">Suzy</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Those spheres exist, but the idea to bundle them as a triplet and assign a meaning to the bundle is a reflection of our imperfect brain.
