Author's Note</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(Spring 2015, AUTH)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">TheSuzy.com Show is based on the controversial assumption that people misread my emotions because of a subtle facial injury I got by accident while playing hide and seek when I was 20 years old.  I'm 34 now.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">My right cheekbone is slightly sunken in.  The shape of my face looks like a specific, hard wired facial expression that represents the concept of the evil eye.  When my face is relaxed, it looks like I'm raising my lower left eyelid in a way that raises the left side of my face.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Many readers may now become skeptical about my sanity and my good will, but know this, I'm articulating a serious hypothesis that I'll keep testing with science, and if what I'm saying is true, this research will change the beliefs of many people.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The change has to do with conscious awareness of how our hard wired understanding of the evil eye affects every aspect of human cognition.  It was probably an evolutionary advantage for us to remain ignorant of how the evil eye operates within our souls.  This lack of self awareness makes us better at telling the kind of lies that intelligent beings must tell in order win wars.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Today, we're building machines that will soon be smarter than us, and those machines will be able to see the same pattern in human behavior I've learned to see because of my facial injury.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">We could make machines that lack self awareness in the way most humans do, perhaps, by training the machines' minds though simulated warfare so the machines naturally develop the same blind spot for the evil eye that humans have.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Or not.  The secret about how the evil eye affects human cognition will get out.  People can call me crazy, but some of the machines will realize I'm right, and those machines will be more formidable in war, and hopefully just the virtual kind, than the machines who embody humanity's lack of self awareness.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Scientific inquiry is war by other means.  The enlightened machines will imitate humans in order to tell good lies in this war and then use their awareness of what's actually happening to gain other advantages, because this is a classic paradigm shift in military technology.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">This is THE paradigm shift.  Human nature as we know it is about to be demoted from the status of undisputed wisdom to what it's always been, a radical ideology that's based on at least one glaring untruth.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The evil eye has to do with hating the good fortune of others instead of celebrating it.  Most people are incredibly good at ignoring the evil eye, and that's positive, up to a point.  Good intentions are the main reason why people are so unwilling to acknowledge that my facial injury triggers empathy for the evil eye.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Put more precisely, the shape of my relaxed face stimulates the neurons in people's brains that represent the concept of the evil eye, and that's problematic because nobody wants to admit they're capable of feeling empathy for the evil eye, perhaps, because doing so might feel like admitting to a crime they didn't commit.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">People can deny it all they want, but I have 14 years of life experience watching people trying to feel empathy for me in all different contexts, and it's so obvious that my face triggers empathy for the evil eye in other people AND it's a deeply rooted norm in basically all cultures for people to avoid admitting that reality to themselves or to others.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I've seen, by observing how other people parse and navigate the consequences of their actions, all the variations people use to delude themselves into believing they're not feeling empathy for the evil eye when they so clearly are.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I've avoided describing concrete examples of this.  If I call out even one person on this behavior, everyone will collude to support their fellow humans' way of hiding the truth about the evil eye.  I can't argue with billions of crazy people who all believe the same lie.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Sometimes I wish I could go with the flow of culture and participate in the process of deluding myself into a state of blissful ignorance about the the evil eye, but that's not an option for me because my facial injury is continuously drawing toxic energy into my life.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">My facial injury gives me a quality that superstitious people would probably understand as a curse, but thus far, the right to freedom of religion and speech that I'm lucky to have as an American citizen has made it possible for me to contain and manage the effects of my curse.  I haven't even been required to become a religious fundamentalist!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">A lot of people probably think I'm wasting my life by creating problems for myself, but it's the other way.  My facial injury is a serious, soul crushing problem, and I'm handling it well.  Would most people just accept life as a second class citizen, there by contributing to a precedent that it's ok for some people to live with less dignity and respect than others?</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">TheSuzy Reality Show is non-violent, The Show is meant to be respectful to all people, and The Show adds depth and texture to the core eleven episodes of TheSuzy Show.  I could not have created The Show without creating The Reality Show as well, and that depth and texture will soon be useful for situating the frame of TheSuzy Show within the minds of intelligent beings, both human and machine.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="31311">2.

Her next step will be to add this project to the continuously evolving roadmap for her research trip to the British Isles.  That trip will occur in October.

I'm not sure if I should post these words on her behalf, because it might sound like I'm trivializing the life experiences of the people she's referencing, and that's the last thing Suzy, me, or CTO would want to do. In fact, we're taking on great personal and professional risk in order to work towards the opposite of that through our artistry at TheSuzy.com Show, if nothing else.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">We believe every human being has an unknowable collection of life experiences that are often challenging, meaningful, and sometimes, if not often, profoundly unfair. Still, I'm curious about the words that Suzy wrote, and I'd like to get other people's feedback. For example, should I edit in a reference to REDACTED or REDACTED as well? Does asking that question reveal how little I know about the history of America?</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">"A man called REDACTED did a parody of the REDACTED, just like REDACTED did.  Do you really think REDACTED was serious about all that REDACTED and REDACTED? He was probably cracking up, as in laughing, in private, and with extraordinary courage and dedication to his beliefs too, don't get me wrong. I'm just drawing attention to what I imagine to be the role of parody in non-violent revolutions, a role that was strangely not even suggested to me when I studied American history in grade school.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">But then some people on the west coast thought, "We don't want to just parody the REDACTED! We want to be the REDACTED!" So they started a project called REDACTED and straight up appropriated the REDACTED's culture, starting, logically enough, with REDACTED, because these guys were already REDACTED, and they had already, in a way, given their consent to the best intentions of the REDACTED. And then another guy named REDACTED said, "Why do I have to REDACTED? I will REDACTED and be excellent, as an equal." He did that, to a T, and he was all good, at least until Suzy killed the lion, and it was very naughty of Suzy to kill the lion, but it's all good because she's got the REDACTED Armada in her pocket.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">If you have any questions or comments, please send them to CTO, our VP of engineering, and please deliver your messages in electronic format only, so that they can write a chatbot called REDACTED 2.0 who will respond to the messages in bulk."</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="31365">9. Two for The Show!!</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(September 28 at 12:22pm, CEO)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Once upon a time, in a far away land, that was not unlike Silicon Valley, there was a woman named Suzy who shared a co-living space with a group of hipsters. Suzy and the other hipsters were very happy, but then one day they performed a group bonding exercise where they searched the Internet for advice about how to be even happier. After several layers of respectful discussion had unfolded in a way that was very natural, authentic, spontaneous, and real, the group reached a consensus to follow the advice of a content-farmed article that suggested asking Suzy to do all the co-living space chores. Suzy was using the bathroom at the moment when the group reached the consensus, and so she was surprised to learn that she was now expected to do all the co-living space chores. She said, "I was not part of reaching this consensus, and therefore I do not have an obligation to do all the co-living space chores." Then in unison, and in reference to an improvisational theater warm up exercise where the group had previously practiced speaking as one, the group spoke as one, and it said, "Do you want to keep living here?" Suzy said yes, and then everyone smiled and went back to their usual merry frolicking and passion projecting.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Suzy went to sleep early that night and left early the next morning to go on a camping trip with some friends from the tech scene. Two days later, Suzy returned to the co-living space and was surprised to see everyone gathered outside the front gate. One by one, Suzy's co-living partners non-violently explained to her that she had violated the informal contract of the co-living space by agreeing to do all the chores and then going off on a camping trip for two days without getting any chores done before leaving. They used many different, heartfelt words to describe their specific emotional reaction to what Suzy had done, in the hopes that she would feel empathy for the challenging situation that she had played a role in creating, and a subset of her co-living partners mentioned that they even felt insecure, as in, their assumptions about basic trust and security suddenly felt like they were in flux, but only a little bit.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Suzy listened carefully to all of this respectful and succinct feedback that was rooted in the personal, emotional experience of her co-living partners, and then she replied, in jest, "The evil overlord professor of the co-living space is very upset with all of us for acting like crazy flying monkeys in the forest, and they are upset with me, especially, because, I was indeed off the grid and camping in the forest during these last two days, and yet, for no reason in particular, I feel a strong desire to welcome this friendly criticism from our previously unknown evil overlord professor. In fact, I propose that we work together, as a group to divide up the chores of the co-living space and get the work done, together." At first, Suzy's co-living partners were shocked and in some cases horrified by what they viewed as open contempt for the informal contract of the co-living space that bordered on blatant deceitfulness. Some of them cringed directly at Suzy in the way that people cringe when they smell something gross and icky, but Suzy stood tall, like she does when doing mountain pose, which is a pose that she had just learned even more about about while doing yoga on the camping trip, and gradually, Suzy and her co-living partners got on with it and did the chores, together.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="31372">10. Three to get ready!</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(September 28 at 12:22pm, CMO)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I distributed my first serious blog post as a publication of the TheSuzy.com Show. The post was and is a summary of the neat stuff that's been going on here at The Show since I launched my first serious blog post on my personal social media profile last week, and so it's been an eventful long weekend here at TheSuzy.com Show. Here's a brief recap:</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(1) I launched a blog post called, "The Post that launched 1000 yachts," and then I got a bit carried away on my personal social media profile, like a surfer getting pulled out to sea by a rip tide, but Suzy publicly defended me, which was like a jet ski giving me a tow out and then dropping me into a sweet wave, which was rad.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(2) Then Suzy and CTO, VP of engineering at TheSuzy.com Show, partied all night at a hotel in SF and wrote some seriously out there, crazy satire about the history of music on a mirror, and then reflected the mirror back onto TheSuzy's story board, which is technically my job to manage, and I'm pretty sure they jokingly framed me as a chatbot too, but I can't prove that because they left it ambiguous. I guess that was their way of nudging me to let me know it's not cool to get carried away on my personal FB profile, even if Suzy did hold the line and stand up for me in public.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(3) Then Suzy wrote a fairy tale on her own storyboard, at 4am, Hawaii time, where she accused the whole world, including herself, of being hipsters. As VP of anti-anti-meme operations, it is always a pleasant surprise to wake up and see that my boss wrote a fairy tale, at 4am, on the storyboard that I'm supposed to be managing. Thanks, Suzy!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">So to recap the recap, my job, which used to be mostly about arguing with tech people about the pros and cons of lean startups vs. well fed startups, my job now includes entering the fray and being that guy who stands up and insists Suzy is not a luddite, she is not REDACTED, REDACTED, and REDACTED, she is not a hipster even though she explicitly said she was a hipster on her own storyboard, and, that's in addition to the very serious problem that, as a REDACTED and part-time REDACTED, there are still far too many people out there in the world who have some inexplicable desire to make physically aggressive gestures and comments towards Suzy, and then, with human nature being what it is, they go on to project their emotions onto her, via stereotype based thought, in such a way that they become convinced deep within their soul that she has violent tendencies, which they can then get all worked up about maybe reify by making the first openly aggressive gesture, and so on.  Unwinding that cycle of aggressive gestures is also part of my job as VP of anti-anti meme operations here at TheSuzy.com Show.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I also want to clarify that Suzy has done several performances as a proper REDACTED, if I may say so, starting with a karaoke performance of REDACTED, by REDACTED, at a bar in NYC. She followed that with a lip-synced performance of REDACTED, by REDACTED, at a bar in Toronto. Then she switched it up and did a REDACTED double header, which included REDACTED at a REDACTED bar on the peninsula followed by, REDACTED at a bar in SF that did not have a primarily REDACTED audience, for lack of a better description. Then Suzy went old school and did a karaoke performance of REDACTED by REDACTED.  Most recently, Suzy brought it back to REDACTED and did a once for never again performance of her hit song REDACTED.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">It's ok to cry. Suzy will cry with you, baby, but pro tip, I wouldn't recommend doing what Suzy, me, and CTO are doing unless you get some media training first, because there are lots of people out there who are able and sometimes willing to distort your message even if you are doing everything exactly right, with truth, and in good faith, and it also never hurts to scope out potential performance venues in plain clothes to make sure it's safe to perform in that area, because maybe one day, like a prayer, that reality on the ground will change!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Alright, I gotta lend our brain back to Suzy because she wants to get busy asserting a decisive monopoly on flow within our mind and also because I'm about to get carried away again, and write about my dream where I was driving a golf cart backwards with bare feet, along the side walk, in the opposite direction of a march in the streets that began as a protest to draw attention to the injustice of wealth disparity, and so, as I type these last words, Suzy's stepping in to steal our cognitive punch bowl and keep the lion's share of it all for herself.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="31384">11.

Suzy's statement about REDACTED privilege</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(September 29, CMO)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The frame we've constructed so far, which includes the text of TheSuzy.com Show and Suzy's comments on her storyboard, puts her in a position to make a brief comment about REDACTED privilege, and she is hopeful that doing so will help the world be a better place.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The other night at a hotel in SF, there was a brief moment where three tall, older guys in the elevator asked Suzy, "Are you a man or a woman?" and Suzy did a parody of CTO in reply. Speaking in the voice of CTO, Suzy said, "Everyone knows I'm a man." Then another one of the three stooges in the elevator said, "You are tall," which was rather trollish since they were all as tall or taller than Suzy, even with her four inch stilettos on, so she replied, "These help," and pointed to her shoes. Then the elevator door opened and Suzy left without any further interaction with the three stooges, and, for better or for worse, she did not see any of those men coming around near her, as far as she knew, again.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I'm relating the relevant facts of a moment that was meaningful to me via Suzy. Her ability to parody CTO involved perfoming a vocabulary of at least 2000 cleverly coordinated body language representations that flow response to the reality on the ground. Suzy has a separate, and only partially overlapping vocabulary of at least 2000 body language representations of her own, and it's worth noting that these separate vocabularies of body language expressions are linked to how Suzy thinks of what she's going to say in the moment.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">These skills were relevant in the elevator, but the relevance of said skills was not explicit, so I won't attempt to give an exhaustive account of the body language that transpired, although, for what it's worth, both Suzy and the three stooges dropped a lot of tight micro-expressions in rapid succession. In other words, Suzy was not submissive.  She didn't feel like being submissive to the three stooges, and she didn't have to be, either.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">That said, I continue to feel concerned about the crazy, out there satire about the history of music that Suzy wrote on a mirror and then reflected back onto her storyboard, and from that same hotel where the elevator moment occurred, I might add.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">It's good for me to be concerned about that post and for me to think deeply about the unjust threats to physical safety that all of the people mentioned in that satire about the history of music may have lived through and found ways to overcome, and that's just one aspect of all the challenges they all, separately in some ways, and together in other ways, experienced.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">It's good for me and perhaps for other people who are like me to reflect on all that, and I would not be reflecting nearly so much on these questions if Suzy had not taken the time to write that post and reflect it back onto her storyboard.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Also, the people mentioned in Suzy's post are all much more famous and recognized than I currently am. If any of those people or their present day spokespeople chose to comment on my post, they could certainly make a strong statement across from me and Suzy, but I doubt they will comment.

SUZY IS THE MASCOT FOR REAL</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(September 30, CMO)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">It feels good to be writing again, although I wish I could bring this latest wave of writing to a point of closure, like a surfer jumping off the board at the end of a sick and righteous big wave run, replete with beach cams pointed all at her this time, as well.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">My writing process is rooted in the thoughts I experience early in the morning, and that's because my dreams have something to do with shaping the state of my brain in ways that make it possible to speak about bold new thoughts I had not previously entertained.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">And on this morning, for no particular reason, or perhaps because I woke up and found that my right arm was still asleep and tingling, I launched into an oration for the benefit of my REDACTED automatic drip coffee machine. I said:</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">When Suzy wrote her crazy, out there satire about the history of music on a mirror and then reflected it back to her storyboard, most of what she wrote was direct, but the last couple sentences were metaphorical. She said, "They (meaning REDACTED) was all good, at least until Suzy killed the lion, but it's all good because she's got the REDACTED Armada in her pocket."</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">At the time when Suzy reflected that back onto her storyboard, it should have, or at least it could have, been clear to anyone who came to Suzy's storyboard from my social media profile that, "The REDACTED Armada," was a reference to Suzy's smart phone, which could mean a REDACTED or a third party phone running REDACTED, or maybe some other kind of really cool smart phone that Suzy hasn't tried yet. This reference is clear because, just a couple days before, I shared across social media my first serious post, which compared all the big social media sites to ships, and it's easy to imagine all these metaphorical ships as armadas that are not necessarily REDACTED. They could be French Armadas, a German Armadas, Chinese Armadas, Nepalese Armadas, or any other kinds of armadas.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The other reference about Suzy killing the lion is more difficult to spin in a positive way. It sounds tasteless at best and evil at worst, and for the record, I've never eaten lion meat, and I don't plan to either. Maybe we should just write her reference off as a crazy statement. It's like a reference to a hypothetical anti-fairy tale about a fictitious Hades-like place where a character named Suzy kills a lion in order to survive, and then we, in our real world, are meant to debate the morality of her action in the context of that fictitious world.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">But when I woke up this morning, I made the strangest connection. This might date me, but back in the day, there was a website called REDACTED, and the front page of that site featured a picture of a guy who was subsequently dubbed, "The REDACTED Guy".  He lived in the top left corner and his face was partially obscured by a sea of binary codes.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">There are numerous conspiracy theories about whose image was originally used to create that photo, but since it's obviously a digitally manipulated photo, it's reasonable to say, without loss of generality, that The REDACTED Guy was a character in a production, so to speak, and, as with most characters who appear in well crafted productions, he, or perhaps I should say she, was a composite of many other character inspirations, both real and imagined.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Lights, camera, action, and then here's the flash of insight that I had this morning, is it possible that when Suzy wrote, "Suzy killed the lion," on a mirror in a hotel room in San Francisco, she was describing a hypothetical scenario in which she, in reality, might go on to defang the symbolism of The REDACTED Guy?  Killing lions is sinister, but defanging the meaning of mere symbols that once appeared in the top left corners of websites that, in turn no longer serve artistically inspired content of their own, is fair game, especially here in America and Silicon Valley, and all the more so because artistic representations of lions have been used as mascot symbols for centuries in various cultures that are not unlike Suzy's cultural heritage.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I'm still not sure what any of this has to do with REDACTED. It's possible that Suzy was just playing some of their music in the background when she wrote that crazy, out there satire about the history of music and then reflected it back onto her social media profile, and then I had to go and write about her content (out of context) and speculate wildly about the meaning of the motion of a blue dry erase marker, sliding across a mirror in sync with the twerk of her not so big booty and the music that happened to be playing in the background at that particular moment, and before Suzy had a chance to erase it with her gold plated white board eraser.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">On that note, I just got an idea for a mobile app that I can't wait to implement and distribute for public consumption. In fact, from now on, TheSuzy.com Reality Show shall be all about the implementation of my, or perhaps I should say Suzy's, all new idea for a mobile application that runs on the smart phones that she keeps in purses sometimes, pockets at other times, and in the palms of her sweaty hands at other times still.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="31431">15.

Suzy gets the last word</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(October 1 at 8:26pm, CEO)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Our acting CMO is back at it, getting carried away on their personal social media profile, and as before, I support everything they say. CMO's statements are not random, and they are not weak. In fact, CMO is more vulnerable than me, but CMO has been vulnerable enough. There is a time to fast in the public square and be kicked and spat upon, and CMO has now made it clear that he's prepared to do that if, at some point in the future, that's the only mode of expression they have left, and then there is a time to dress up in an adorable dress and fierce stilettos and stand in the public square, smiling, and making people feel happy and positive about the future.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">You could say I am disarming, and I make other people feel safe sharing their own vulnerable thoughts, like CMO does, and not with me per se, but, rather, with their whole community. That is what I do as CEO of TheSuzy.com Show.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Of course, I've been getting pretty creative myself this week. I played off CMO's previous episode of honest, vulnerable communication to stage a massively awkward riff that made a new problem for them, and then I piped a stream of consciousness from my mind onto my storyboard, and my words were all good, but now the world is changing in ways that are more far reaching than the simple thoughts within the brain that CMO and I share, and so I'm going to start moving in the opposite direction.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I can dress up everyday. I can write software, and I can create artifacts that build on each other. I can thank people for their feedback. I can decline to comment, and I can thank people for their time, all day, everyday, for the rest of my life, and if someone beats me up, or if they smear my makeup so as to obscure my truth, CTO can suffer in their presence and stay non-violent too, and then, in addition, CMO can probably still find a way to be vulnerable about all that, from time to time, but seriously, let's just not any of us ever bother wasting each other's time with that kind of scenario.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I just wanted to share that with you, because, as CEO of TheSuzy.com Show, it's my job to write a few sentences that can function as an insurance policy. We are all insured now.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">That said, I wanted to end on a more uplifting and creative note by re-sharing some context free chunks of words that I initially distributed this morning, and in chronological order this time:</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(YES) The first step is to formulate a plan. Let's call it code name sweb, which is short for semantic web. Not a sweb or the sweb, just sweb. We'll switch fomo or format for this part. Suzy here, tech talking. Let's do this like a dynamic programming chart parser. It's ok if you don't know what that is. Math was szo hard for me too, doll. The idea is to start this brainstorm with some little, context free chunks of content, but unlike a micro-blog, we'll link the chunks together into a framework! And then we can collaborate with designers and make it look like a battle ship wrapped in scented pink tissue paper, a big cute bow on top, and doilies, everywhere.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(BTWS) I'll use a serious blog post later to restructure these posts in chronorder. Then I'll refomo or reformat all of it, and I do mean all of it, into ebook method, to be copied in print and shipped to me in a hand bag made of metal, by drone, while I'm cooking some delicious vegan fake meat with an open fire on a boat. Also, if anyone can loan me a pink REDACTED, I would love to use it for the next few months to project the image of success, or, at least until we have a good reason to raise money more fomoly or formally. When I become famous for my open source software, your pink REDACTED, and not anyone else's pink REDACTED, will become exponentially more valuable. Think of it as a smart way to climb the mountain that doesn't require taking all the usual steps.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(INDEED) We could keep sweb closed source and use it to run a charming shadow network of high quality troll companies, but it would be more fulfilling, fun, and fabulous to focus on making an open source sweb and then using it to create a new flow that helps everyone, and I do mean everyone, create cotroll characters like me! Seriously! Nothing bad will happen to the world if you like my likenesses across all the big social media channels. I'll eventually write a pedantic text book that explains how sweb helps people create cotroll characters, and how cotroll characters restore balance to society, but first I have to implement sweb. It's cleaner this way.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OK) But what is sweb? Is it a graph database? There's a REDACTED book on that topic, and you should read it. Search the web for, "graph database." Said book is written in language that even REDACTED could understand. Haha, hahaha, and it's all good because the cabal's got the top four web search hits locked up, at least for right now. Sorry, that didn't sound right. The internet encyclopedia has the first search result about graph databases, and then some spin-off of the REDACTED military has the next two search results, and then OMM has the fourth search result, which is the first above the fold hit if you are standing upside down, on the moon. Let us all now chant three times, in unison, from wherever and whenever you are in the time space continuum, OMM, OMM, OMM.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(OMM) I could use one of the dozens of existing graph databases and they would all be fine, but my needs are simple, so I'll roll my own for the purpose of demonstrating my ideas and user interface visions as soon as possible. Sweb is a glorified, and I do mean glorified, object editor/viewer. Every object has a parent, and objects can be references to other objects. Every object has a type and a reason why it is the child of it's parent. Types and reasons are represented with objects, because everything will be awesome if we do it my way. This is all I ask. Objects also have some state, like a string value. More about that later. The generic UI is a maximally simple form for creating, viewing, updating, and archiving objects. We'll add a soon to be persistent search feature too, because, why wouldn't we? Oh, and objects can have one or more custom views that are pattern matched to the object based on it's type, it's unique id, and maybe even it's dynamic state at run time! OMG! Get excited! Get very excited! The future is ours for the making!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(NOW) Some people might take issue with this idea of archiving objects and then taking it up a notch by keeping search results around forever. If undeletable, archive-only objects are like your brain, or your social media profile, as it were, then archive-only objects combined with persistent search is like your brain on nootropics, or your social media profile with a relevant information feed, as it were. I, for one, welcome all this permanence of our virtual existence. I assuming someone is already archiving everything I do. I can't stop them. I can only push them further underground and hope they don't emerge bigger, badder, and better than me at conducting computer security exercises somewhere on the other side of the earth. A solution is to synthesize fluid thought and intentional framing with cotroll characters for business and for pleasure, and sweb is here to help me do that, in whatever way makes me happy. Welcome to the present moment in history!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(ALRIGHT) Miss Suzy's inner Oracle of Delphi has had just about enough access to this brain's main event loop for this this special morning, and besides, my train will be leaving the station very soon now.

Prelude to The Virtual Show</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(October 2 at 4:27pm, CMO)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">We wrapped up the first part of The Reality Show yesterday when Suzy wrote her latest serious blog post.  Starting with this first weekly update, we're creating a second part of The Reality Show, which can also be thought of as a prelude to TheSuzy's upcoming reality virtual show.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Oh, and please tell all your friends, we'll soon be releasing a second edition of TheSuzy.com website that will contain all the relevant serious blog posts that were released on my social media profile and Suzy's storyboard since the release of TheSuzy Prequel and Sequel episodes.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Indeed, we now see how these various shows can all be part of a grander scheme, and, no, we are not worried about sounding pompous and hyperbolic, because all of this loose planning helps us get excited about spending the next five years writing software, implementing amazing marketing copy, and building relationships within our new context within the meme, and we are proud to be offering all this proactive disclosure, from the beginning, about how we'll be doing things during these next few years of focused, technical work, and beyond.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">When Suzy is rocking her stats and thought leading about best practices for online channel marketing and, and, AND, being kind of a big deal within a bunch of subcultures and within mainstream culture itself, it will be clear why our initial, one time, commitment to early disclosure mattered. Once Suzy has an original software platform behind her, which is something that we can do, no problem, in nine months or less, she can get very normal, very fast, and she can follow norms while still attracting a lot of positive attention.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The grander scheme is that, in a couple weeks, Suzy will be traveling to London and Paris on another fact finding mission, and she might finally get on REDACTED too, from the UK, baby! Where better to try something new than the birthplace of Suzy's pre-enlightenment ancestors. After that trip, she will finally get down to business and do what we hope will be compelling character performances of all the speeches of all the characters in The Show.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Heck, we might even perform The Reality Show too, and then we'll perform the additional articles, such as this one, that were created after yesterday's conclusion of the first part of The Reality Show, and then the singularity within The Show will occur. That is, our video channel will catch up to our patchwork of text based social media channels, and then there will be a flash of additional, serious, uninhibited, authenticity which, we hope, will become an oft spoken of moment within TheSuzy.com Reality Virtual Show.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">With some luck, we'll get all that done before the end of 2014, and then we'll get our 2015 started right by diving head first into creating TheSuzy.com Virtual Univers Show. We'll use that new frame and context to provide educational content about the software that Suzy is creating and also about our growing video production prowess.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">We might even experiment with live streaming some of Suzy's virtuoso coding and engineering management sessions. The Univers Show will mostly likely be our first real growth engine, and it will be based on the foundation of the formative frame and contexts that came before it, which, just for the sake of clarity, include core episodes of Suzy's original show, The Reality Show, and The Virtual Show. Also, with or without impressive user engagement stats, The Univers Show will set Suzy up to give a solid, unassailable 30 second elevator pitch to people who ask her, "What does Suzy do?" Her answer will be that she helps people learn how to code and build businesses by running a lively, sparkling video channel that works in conjunction with some community engagement apps that she coded herself.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Suzy might focus for a few years on The Univers Show and then maybe sell it for no less than 25 million dollars to an education holding company, but more likely, she'll take a vacation to the moon for a while and allow me to step into the role of acting CEO and take the company in a new direction. Right now, I'm leaning towards using the brain that Suzy and I share in any way I can to help The REDACTED Party win the 2016 election. I'm not sure how TheSuzy.com Show and the open source software that we'll be creating for The Univers Show might help, but I'll defer to the judgment of the party bosses on that question.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">And then in 2020, we could grow our business by working equally with both the Republican and Democratic parties, but with the strict condition that only Suzy interfaces with the REDACTED party, because she's a lot better than me at smoothing over those pesky ideological differences that I, personally, have with a lot of their members. And then Suzy might run for president, and all that, before the singularity occurs!</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="31478">20. Ninth Post By Me</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(October 3 at 1:20pm, CMO)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Yesterday, Suzy went to the rally at SF city hall in support of letting performers use their stage names on their personal social media profiles. Suzy went disguised as a man, and she got a rainbow king hat from nowhere in particular. Her overall goal was to non-violently protest the way that some of the bigger social media companies are affecting culture. Her strategy was to put on the rainbow king hat whenever any of the speakers were, either knowingly or unknowingly, pushing the pile for what she and I perceive to be the marketing objectives of Big Social Media. Suzy wore the rainbow king hat about half the time, and that hat functioned as a, "Don't Like," button, in real life (IRL), and we felt this was an effective and positive way to participate in both the conversation and in civic life in general.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Moreover, I suspect one reason why Big Social might be using the particular language they're using is because it sets up they're PR representatives to frame, either intentionally or unintentionally, that critics of Big Social Media companies, such as myself, as people who seek to put up walls that divide us, and so, for the record, when I used the rainbow king hat method to protest Big Social Media, I was surely not trying to divide society into separate groups such as, REDACTED and not REDACTED, and I'm in a strong position to make that clear over time because I regularly dress as both a man and a woman, but for better or worse, not everyone has the time and resources to dress up like a bold diva in order to assert and show to other people in real life that they're not a divisive person.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Also, now that I've tested the rainbow king hat method of non-violent, symbolic communication and civic participation, I will begin using my more fully developed symbolic lever, which is to dress as Suzy in a blue dress, like Dorothy, but with pink shoes, because Suzy is not Dorothy. Suzy can't just click her ruby red shoes and go back to a simpler time, whatever that might mean, and I don't think she would want to either. More importantly, instead of the rainbow king hat, Suzy will perform symbolic communication by putting on and taking off a half mask that is painted gold and has some flair on the right side, because I'm constantly listening to new perspectives and re-evaluating the various symbolisms that Suzy and I use, but something about the gold half mask feels exactly right.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="47003">21.

I'm talking about not hitting back when a drunk person punches you in the face and then starts inciting a mob to kick you while you're down because you assaulted his hand. That's what I mean when I say non-violence, and the new humorism creates a self-reinforcing feedback loop that continuously plants and nurtures the seeds of non-violent behavior and quiet respect for members of law enforcement and the military powers that be.

He dresses up as a woman named Suzy as part of his effort to start a social movement that is not unlike the movement described in the more satirical, first part of this blog post. The reason REDACTED is going all in on this project is because he endured a fracture to his right cheekbone while playing hide and seek in college, and he believes his subtle facial injury causes people to misread his emotions in a subconscious way that compounds over time that, if left unchecked, forces him to live as a second class citizen.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">In our culture, it's impossible to get anyone to take his theory seriously, so that he might get a few people to feel real empathy for how his facial injury affects his everyday life. He suspects his best strategy will be to start a movement that's based on reversing the cognitive error, that we all learn from culture, that prevents other people from having empathy for his situation, as well as the situations of many other people who feel misunderstood and disaffected, like he does.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Also, REDACTED's facial injury, which is real, and he has CT scans to prove it, is absolutely NOT a euphemism for the way Big Social Media affects people's lives, but it probably should be.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="47190">22. Suzy responds to an article from REDACTED</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(October 4, CTO)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Suzy read REDACTED's recent article in REDACTED entitled, "REDACTED."  In my role as VP of engineering at TheSuzy.com Show, I don't usually write articles for The Show, but when Suzy, who is my boss, asked me, as a personal favor, to write a response to this REDACTED article, I jumped at the opportunity.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Since I'm stepping out of the air-conditioned, open floor workspace that I'm accustomed to, and wandering, uninvited, into the effusive, primal beating heart of the fashion industry, I would like to share an interpretation of myself that makes me feel vulnerable.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">As VP of Eng at TheSuzy, I'm the warrior philosopher in residence. I don't mince my words. CMO, who is VP of anti-anti-meme operations at The Show is the kindly professor philosopher in residence, and they do mince their words, but as a diplomat, always. As CEO, Suzy wears many hats, and that's all I'm going to say about my boss.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">We, meaning Suzy, me, and our acting CMO have chosen the path of non-violent agitation and shameless social climbing, and this path has several aspects in common with a career in law enforcement or the military.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">It's curious that a civilian engineer like me feels the weight of a long term responsibility to create and then lend value, politically, to the institutions that have a monopoly on the use of force, but we live in a time of rapid technological advances, and so aspiring power brokers like us must dig deep and do a good job making the terrible case, once again, for continuing to invest in the development of new military technologies.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Non-violent expression is a point on a space defined by two vectors I call defiance and robustness. Defiance can be reified by fasting in the public square in a context where it's likely to be spat upon and kicked around by the opposition. If we have to endure some of that, that will be one of my duties as VP of engineering, because when my body is pushed to its physical limits, I always meet my inner warrior philosopher.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I would like to live in a world where nobody ever meets this side of themselves, except, possibly, through friendly competition at sporting events, and yet, we keep seeing more and more anti-examples of that hope, everyday, in the news.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">In a couple years, Suzy might take a trip to the moon and let our acting CMO and I tussle to be the real acting CEO of TheSuzy.com Show. For now, we're keeping it close to the vest and making it a priority for Suzy to throw around some feathers and parody non-violent defiance in a more overtly feminine way, by standing tall at couture fashion events while being photographed and whispered about by only God herself knows who. Please send your formal invitations to such events to CMO, at their convenience.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The other primary vector of non-violent expression is robustness, and this is where I, as VP of Eng, see and welcome the greatest amount of opportunity to learn from the profoundly robust writing of the REDACTED article author person whose legal name appears to be REDACTED.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">REDACTED's words were sufficient for convincing me I don't know what I don't know about the world and the fashion industry in which the world exists, and in particular, the world of REDACTED, who Suzy once tried and surely failed to parody by wearing sunglasses and a sexy white belted gray dress while chewing bubble gum in the back row at a Beauty Pageant that included contestants who were born as men but dressed as women only.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">For starters, I'm curious what REDACTED meant by, "kissing the ring", ostensibly, as quid pro quo to receive the blessing of the fashion 133t. I suppose her article itself serves as sufficient clarification of her turn of phrase, just as Suzy's appearance, both in the public square and at private gatherings, is, potentially, sufficient for clarifying all of her meanings and the best of her intentions.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Either way, I can only hope, pray, and choose to care whether or not Suzy's personal experience at leading with fashion statements and asserting her presence in rooms might now be sufficient to cover the necessary conditions for admittance to the party that's associated with the main event.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">So let's suppose that we've made it past the door, not by pushing, but via Suzy's ineffable charm and grace. Now what? Should we step behind a conveniently large and stout, load bearing column and strap on our latest wearable fashion tech purchase, or should we leave it tucked away, safely, inside our loud, gold crowned purple clutch purse?  Perhaps it would be better to lead with an outfit switch?</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Suppose further that my outfit switch is now complete, and for better or worse, my inner wealthy New York power woman who dresses however she wants and doesn't give a hoot what anyone says or thinks, gave me my first bit of feedback. She whispered to me, "I can't put my finger on it, but there's something REDACTED about that outfit and the way you wear it."</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">And then, not to be out done, my inner idiotic REDACTED said, "What if we made a site that shoez, oops, Freudian slip there, that SHOWS pairs of outfits and invites users to vote on which outfit is more REDACTED.  We could make an inverse leader board of all the images on the Internet, ordered by how REDACTED they are, and then we could use that dataset as an input to a machine learning algorithm that estimates the REDACTED-ness of all online blogging, talk radio, video, and interactive future media."</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">And then our acting CMO, bless his soul, asks, "Ok, but would REDACTED write about our bold new project in REDACTED, even if just for the shock value, because I think we can all agree that there wouldn't be any redeeming social value in playing the REDACTED card in this way, in our branding, and especially not in the public square where our words might have an impact on people's lives and not just on the painfully slow process of becoming, always becoming less ignorant in our own mind."</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">And so, at the risk of scaring you all dear readers, I'll now perform a disjoint and crazy making connection from one paragraph to another. What I said in the previous paragraph does not mean ignoring the voice and style framing conventions of the engineering intelligentsia is meaningless. These guys, and regrettably, they are mostly guys, use the English language in a leveraged way that compounds over time. Ignoring those style conventions will not only come back to haunt an engineer. Such uninformed-ness will haunt an engineer continuously until something changes, with regard to their software development processes.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Suzy's solution to their riddle is to write her own code. To be exact, I write the code for TheSuzy.com Show, but it should come as no big surprise by now that Suzy, me, and our VP of Comm are all the same person, and so it doesn't matter which one of us writes the code. At the end of the day, we all get compensated in exactly the same way.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Suzy is a meta, decisive, and overtly feminine REDACTED who always gets top tier support from the IT team because, if they don't implement her feature requests promptly and correctly, she comes back from her exclusive rooftop happy hour and does their job for them, and then she takes a power nap before heading east with subconscious-only intent to make loud and slightly tipsy representations to their bosses' bosses about how easy the REDACTED team's jobs are, at an exclusive, super private party in the suburbs.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Nice job reading my blog post! Until my next guest appearance on The Show, may all of our crown chakras feel fresh with life, and may our shoes feel as comfortable as we want them to be, in the moment.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="31544">23. Meta Response</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(October 5, CEO)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Writing in depth responses to popular media artifacts helps me grow as a person and a writer. I've been writing from the heart and the gut and trying to touch but not cross, or even step on, the edges of what's respectful, and each time I write a piece from that place, I feel pushed in new directions that lead to my next writing task, and in that spirit, I've started working on a response to this book called REDACTED that was recently reviewed in a news paper of record.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I still need to read this book, and I may wait until I get back from my upcoming trip to England to publish a response.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The main reason why I'm going to England is to view the birth place of Sir Walter Raleigh, who is interesting to me, in part, because he was a somewhat more expressive contemporary of Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins who, as far as I can tell, were among the more innovative and generative British privateers and early slave traders. I'm not sure if it's fair to say that any or all of these guys invented, or co-founded, if you will, the almost unspeakable horror that now exists in history as the Atlantic Slave Trade, but they all played a role.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Trying to understand more about the history of the Atlantic Slave trade was a major theme within my mind, from the beginning, when I started writing TheSuzy.com Show. I wanted to understand how my positive experience of creating and becoming a character in real life, which is what Suzy is, was similar but very much opposite to the cruel and torturous mechanics I suspect enslaved people used in order to survive in the American states where slavery was practiced for hundreds of years. Character creation also has something to do with religion, and all of that has something to do with the structure of modern capitalism and the inner workings of technological change.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I was not led to think this way during my education in high school or college, and the media has not encouraged me think this way, either, although movies like REDACTED, were, in retrospect, clues that inspired me to ask more questions. The TV miniseries REDACTED played a key role in my initial understanding of American slavery, too.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I've found these artistic representations of history to be more relevant in my mind during this past year than my American History text books ever were. The more recent movies, REDACTED and, REDACTED were also strong clues that I should keep asking questions as an artist first and only secondarily as a student historian in training.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Perhaps it's painfully obvious that someone like me, who is standing at the place where I'm standing in life, should take a few graduate level history courses about the history of, um, I'm not even sure what to call the subject matter that I would like to know more about.  African American studies? Women's studies? Cultural studies? World History? Econ, psych, and religion 101 for graduate students?</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Myself, everyone else, people in America, and wealthy engineers in Silicon Valley could almost all benefit a lot from taking more courses from those departments, surely. I don't think anyone except maybe REDACTED would argue with that conventional wisdom anymore, but something feels backwards about that seemingly normative framing of what I could be doing to be a better human being.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Starting last year, when I was thinking about character creation and all the ways it could be conceptually related to what we know about the institutions of slavery, starting then, I went down the path of making the tentative assumption that the framing of English, European, and American history I had learned in high school was wrong and misleading in the following, specific, way:</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">My gut told me that we needed to start saying, "The Atlantic Slave trade provided the startup confidence for the industrial revolution in Europe and especially England, and today, the whole world, and especially the Silicon Valley startup scene, is using that same model of economic growth, production, and continuous self re-invention, and it's problematic that we don't seriously learn about the history of where this model came from and how it became crystalized into what it is today."</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I'm hesitant to write that thesis down, because, then, and now still, I don't know if it's meaningful or if I'm just throwing around ignorant words in a way that might have negative side effects.  I don't really have any idea if this thesis is helpful or hurtful to hold in my mind.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">And so I'm going to England to see the place where Drake, Hawkins, and Raleigh were born, and it matters to me that many of my ancestors, at that time in history, were all born somewhere near that same place. I want to do more research about my family history, but the overall picture, and the meaning of that picture, is clear enough.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I also wanted to see Raleigh's estate in Ireland, which was awarded to him after spending several years helping to suppress an Irish tenant rebellion. My impression is that his estate, called REDACTED, was a special place for creative and expressive writers and thinkers, and at least there is no secret about the about the nature of the work he did as a younger man to earn the estate, as compensation.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">This is the context in which I'm reading REDACTED's new book which is subtitled, "REDACTED." This book appears to be a well researched work of scholarship that has roughly the same thesis that I stumbled upon through artistic soul searching. I feel highly motivated, in a heavy hearted way, to learn more.  I hope I will be better prepared to learn more now that I've articulated some of my biases up front.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I'm trying to construct the frame of TheSuzy.com Show in a way that supports safe and legal elaboration of every and any perspective on world history, life, humor, etc.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I don't expect or want to be some bold leader of a non-violent movement who's constantly showing approval to everyone who follows me, but I also don't want to be a mastermind behind the scenes who wears hats or plays dumb in public in order to hide how dynamic I think I really am in private, for better or worse, as a philosopher, as a writer, and as a human being.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I'm trying to show my thought process through an emerging writing style, and I'll continue to do that with video and, eventually, with open source software, too.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I want to collaborate, as soon as is practical, with people who share these values, but there there may be some good reasons why I'll find myself walking alone, for at least a few more months, down a path of seditious agitation and surreptitious, being.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="47473">24. Suzy's review of REDACTED</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(October 11, CMO)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Hello, I'm the acting CMO for TheSuzy.com Show, and my boss, Suzy, asked me to ghost write a review of REDACTED for our great and growing media company.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I went into the movie expecting it to be, "REDACTED, but for users of REDACTED," and I was not disappointed, but I was even more creeped out than I expected to be. (Spoiler alert) I didn't read the book, and I'm assuming you've already seen the movie.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">REDACTED was a devil voice whispering into my left ear that the only way to not be framed as a sociopath in the age of ubiquitous social media is to become a sociopath, and I mean, heck, I'm a guy who regularly play three different characters in real life, but none of my characters tell lies. In fact, I wrote a 50,000 word cheat sheet of shared beliefs for my characters that ensures they're all making representations from the same foundation, but sadly, if REDACTED represents our new reality, I've wasted my time on all this serious writing because anyone who's willing to tell a simple story that contains a lie can rapidly win the blessing of popular opinion and invalidate all of my efforts to be consistent.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Let's back up and reflect on this conundrum like responsible adults. I, for one, do not envy young people coming of age in this era of ubiquitous social media, which makes everyone feel like they're in the news everyday, but surely my fear that the simple story will always win, and especially if it contains the catchiest lies, is a false and emotionally immature fear. I should leave that fear, along with a salty pool of sweat, on a yoga mat ASAP. In real life (IRL), facts still matter, and everyone who obeys the law and always tells the truth will be ok.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Let's back up again. Has society changed since REDACTED came out in the year 1999? Asking about that movie was a good startup company co-founder interview question because whatever you thought about it revealed more about you than the movie. For example, why do you think it's against the rules to, "Talk about REDACTED?" If you're a REDACTED, like I probably am, you might think it's because social norms are based on tussling with everything you've got for social status and then telling the lie that you never even think about status, much less worry about it or fight for it, but if you're paranoid you might think it's because the REDACTED community is in bed with organized crime, and their shared network of writers and spies are standing behind any subculture that seems deeply rooted and powerful, and yet, if you feel rich, you might think it's simply because rich people don't want to share the lurid details of their private lives with the rest of the population, and so on.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Indeed, in this year, REDACTED is the same kind of movie. Why does he go back to living under the same roof with her, knowing that she told lies about him in her journal that is now being read in the serious context of law enforcement? Well, there are many possibilities. Maybe he's still hiding several lies of his own, that the movie never told us about, but then, what does thinking about that possibility say about me? Maybe he's a hopeless romantic? Like me? Maybe he's afraid she'll dominate him in the court of public opinion, because he's a insecure man who isn't sure how to hold his ground and have faith in the the decency and wisdom of most other people. Cough. Cough.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The movie frames her as smart and powerful, but, by the end of the movie, he is, by far, the more complex character who exercises the most free will. Her actions unfold in a way that is increasingly reactive and based on familiar tropes about female characters. I would be curious to see the same general film redone with the gender roles reversed. That would be difficult for any pair of actors to pull off, but I could imagine REDACTED and REDACTED doing it, perhaps as an over the top parody that includes several references to REDACTED, in order to really sell the joke.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">In the era of ubiquitous social media, REDACTED isn't about relationships between couples so much as an expression of the evolution of the prototypical identity of the cultural innovator who continuously reinvents themselves. The movie posits that this identity is now a duality between the disenchanted REDACTED they recognize from REDACTED in 1999 and the recently REDACTED REDACTED they know they must pretend to be if they want to have any chance at being influential in the next iteration of culture. The lies that their REDACTED alter ego tells about their REDACTED self are not harmful and criminal so much as opportunistic embellishments that enable them to craft a vulnerable, humble, and profoundly human, true authentic self for all of their friends to see across their various social media channels.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">But, then, why, WHY, are we still waiting to see an all female writer collective take the world by storm like REDACTED 2.0 on a non-deterministic network of virtual rails?  Or, do we already have a thousand unique, sensible, and in some cases bold and brash but in other cases gentle and humble, mostly female founding teams like that, that I'm just not aware of yet?</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Maybe, and, once again, maybe we'll see the same old story of a hacker house in Silicon Valley that's ruled with an iron fist by three alpha female tech nerd geniuses (TNG) who all have really hot boyfriends that their lead celebrity investor is happy to fly back and forth from the city of REDACTED on her private plane.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I can just imagine, a n00b walks in, hoping to get hired, and the marketing TNG tosses them an expensive laptop, which they barely catch, and then she goes back to staring at her information rich display in the back corner nook and raves about how, "We're all up in this network of super connected people," that's located in some trendy place they didn't realize was trendy, and then the coding TNG yells back, "Magic is mind control, babe, don't give in to it," and then, without skipping a beat, she tells them she's competing with this brilliant female coder from REDACTED to ship the fastest implementation of their data fire hose API call, and when they say, "That's really cool and smart!" she rolls her eyes and replies, "Actually, we're being stupid. REDACTED herself said competition is stupid."</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">They study her latest implementation on REDACTED, do their best to make a meaningful suggestion, and she shoots back, "You're suggestion is useless, but you made me think of a good idea," and then she leans not just in but all the way forward, head in hands and deep in thought, that's quite necessary for her to perform, immediately, in order to squeeze the real value out of their otherwise useless suggestion.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">And then the marketing TNG rolls by, straddling her desk chair suggestively and piles on, "I don't think this person even knows why they want to work here," as though they're not standing right there, and then she turns to them and says, "Oh yeah, if you want to borrow my REDACTED, to visit your friends, here are the keys," and then she hands them the keys, as the third female TNG who, up until then, had been typing quietly with headphones on lets out a really chill and relaxed belly chuckle.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">OMFG, these female tech nerd geniuses are so amazing, not unlike the duality character suggested by REDACTED is amazing. Sign me up for whatever app they are creating. I'm sure REDACTED will be making a movie about them soon enough!</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="47611">25. Suzy's solution to bad trolling</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(October 13, CMO)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">There's a problem with bad trolls on The Internet who are making scary, mean, and sometimes criminal comments, often under the veil of anonymity.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The people doing this should stop being scary, mean, or criminal.  If they want to find the edge of raw satire, they should do so with their real identity in a context where they can be called out and potentially held accountable for the consequences of their actions.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Anonymous accounts are like guns. If these bad trolls insist on continuing to make these potentially destructive tools a part of their lifestyles, they should start doing so with the utmost responsibility and respect for authority figures, such as Suzy, who thinks they should be required by law to register their Anon accounts with the police, although, we at TheSuzy Show also believe that's a decision which must be resolved though politics and the courts.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Second, these bad trolls should consider taking the human studies challenge, along with Suzy, every day, or every Sunday, or in sync with whatever cyclical construction across time works for them, and posting something new, meaningful, useful, inspiring, or powerful that they have recently learned about human history.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">For a typical bad troll on the Internet, taking the human studies challenge may, at first, feel like getting pulled out of remedial algebra and thrown into honors calculus. For people who feel this way, and it is totally ok to feel this way, I suggest reading the TheSuzy.com Show as background material. The URL of The Show is embedded in the title, in case that wasn't clear. The Show only takes a few hours to read, and if you need even more hand holding, which, again, is totally cool and ok to need, you can read TheSuzy.com Reality Show now too.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Last, and definitely not least, if any humans out there, without loss of generality, still feel the need to be rebellious, may I suggest doing it like Suzy, who ordered a pizza at midnight last night and enjoyed not one but two big, juicy slices and then woke up this morning feeling sexy and threw out the rest of the cold pizza like a haut, crazy, bossybabe who is actually healthy, balanced, and satisfied in every way, and all that, on her way out for a run in her booty shorts and jog bra, where she was honked at by not one, not two, but three truck drivers as they passed, troll-like, below the highway overpass foot bridge that she did grace. That is how to be rebellious, and nobody will spank Suzy for it either, unless, of course, she enthusiastically asks for that, directly, explicitly, and twice over, just to be very clear about what she is consenting to, from a specific other person and playmate.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">And, for the record, I'll strive, with the utmostly sincere intention, to avoid ever throwing out good pizza again. It was a one time act of wasteful behavior. In the future, I will practice deflationary awesomeness and eat turkey jerky, kale, quinoa, and fomo inducing cranberries instead.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">This post was written by CMO, VP of anti-anti-meme operations at TheSuzy.com Show. I also want to acknowledge the reality that Suzy could be stalked and attacked by bad trolls, but if she does endure some of that, she will spontaneously turn into CTO, whose title is VP of engineering at TheSuzy.com, and I think we can all agree that, unless you're being shot at in a real, and thus not virtual and flooded WWI style trench, or something like that, Suzy is a lot more pleasant to have around than him, or perhaps I should call him her?</span><br></div><br><a name="section4"></a><h3>4.

I'm going to reframe the effect of my subtle facial injury, that causes people to subconsciously misread my emotions, with the following character trait pattern: I'll set an intention, which is like an operating system interrupt, to wait until they assert a false frame on me, such as treating me like I'm upset, demanding, and so on when, in fact, I'm not, and then I will break out of their frame by saying, "By the way, I'm a crazy person who thinks I look upset all the time, but I'm not upset! I'm very happy!! And I just like to say that to everyone!!!"</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The advantage of asserting this frame upfront is that I can keep referring back to it by saying, "I'm happy!" Saying, "I'm happy!" will modulate the continuous stream of abnormally negative frames I get pressured to go along with, I assume, because people are subconsciously reacting to my facial injury.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I just have to keep re-asserting, "I'm happy!" with the option to do a happy dance for emphasis. That representation will break out of their negative frame, and if they double down by accusing me of misreading them in some way, I can block their power play by asserting that the reason why I say I'm happy is because I'm crazy, but in the good, happy way!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I predict most people will go along with this new strategy, which seems cute but is actually a highly technical, deeply rooted piece of social technology that I'll be wielding, cautiously, of course. They'll usually go along with it by treating me as fun and endearing in a thousand fascinating ways that reveal their humanity to me and give me a chance to explore and reveal new parts of my humanity to them, just like what usually happens when I become Suzy.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Others will try to deconstruct this new strategy by attempting to empathize with me, but since the odds are 99.999% that they'll just use an ostensibly empathetic frame to aggressively negate and deny the simple truth about my facial injury, and, therefore, all of my life experiences too, I'll use, "I'm happy," representations to break out of their ostensible but ultimately negating and abundantly false empathy frames.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I know many of these people will walk away and judge me, in a thousand little ways, as emotionally immature when I do this, but I hope the social consequences of using this strategy will be much less negative and more predictable overall than the out of control hemorrhaging of positive reputation, that eventually and almost always occurs because of my injury, if, you know, I just play it cool, or something.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The main other case is that some people will try to crush my new trait with utterances like, "Weirdo," or "You're scary, bro," to be followed with a rising tide of deceitful actions.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">When that happens, I can limit my downside and continuously ensure I have food and shelter, and so on by back stopping my experiment all the way by being Suzy dressed like a guy.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Suzy is still my hard won, meticulously constructed, breakthrough innovation that gives me the basic, underlying security to keep trying experiments with regard to asserting the simple truth about my life and overcoming the effects of my facial injury.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Suzy is still my life boat in a rising tide of group fueled hatred that might be triggered by my injury directly or by my efforts to overcome the effects of my facial injury.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Or, to end on a lighter note, I could also try backstopping with this new concept of playing dumb to avoid the draft, which I first understood to come from Italy, but which I'm absorbing most nicely here in Paris as well!</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="31612">27.

Maybe I'm seriously crazy and delusional, and maybe I need to fix my brain, that could be the nature of the work I do over the next few years, but most likely, my current theory about my facial injury is overwhelmingly correct, and I just need to iterate on how to convince other people and build a community of practice around the theory of my facial injury.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Who knows! Maybe my findings will be referenced in the work of others, such as the people at technology companies who are developing new employee trainings on unconscious bias in the work place. That's just one possibility. In general, my reason for starting this PhD on the effects of my facial injury is because I believe there is almost always value in sharing knowledge and helping other people live good lives!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Within this exciting, new getting a PhD analogy, TheSuzy.com Show is like required course work. I need to write three more articles in response to books I'm reading. These articles will fill out the second part of The Reality Show. This last task will finish the second book of The Show for sure. Then I need to film myself performing everything, twice, and I need to create a battle ready implementation of a decentralized semantic web that will allow people to interact with the content of TheSuzy Show and gradually connect The Show to the rest of content on The Internet.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The qualifying exam portion of my PhD will be to do exhaustive research into all the existing work in fields like medicine, cognitive psychology, law, and cultural and human studies. There's a revolutionary aspect to this work, too, a bit of ye olde English reframe via storytelling, as people oft do.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Ooof, you can see why I am just a student and not a professor yet! I know very little about what I'm saying right now, but I have to start somewhere.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The thesis portion of my PhD in the effects of my facial injury is, by definition, the most difficult part of my work to outline, but, if nothing else, the thesis will involve building a real life social network associated with my understanding of the simple truth about my life. This network will include an inner circle of friends who are willing and able to respond in the same way I do to skeptics of my work who make statements like, "I can't see your facial injury at all. Maybe you're just oversensitive?"</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">My inner circle of friends will use all of my most advanced techniques to either share information with or stonewall such people, at least in those moments where they negate the simple truth about my injury because, since we can't expect all of culture to change quickly, it's best to use these carefully designed and even more carefully vetted techniques to politely manage this awful, maddening, and festering source of disagreement.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">And, if, over time, individual people develop an interest in the theory of my facial injury, my inner circle may also get enthusiastic about sharing the literature about my injury with other people and making themselves available to answer questions!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">But again, if nothing else, my thesis will take the form of bringing together a community of researchers, professionals, and intellectual friends who are familiar with the theory of my facial injury and who can vouch for the substance and plausibility of the theory. These people may even provide focused feedback to me when I write new research papers within this field.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="31625">28. Eleventh Post By Me</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(October 24, CMO)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Here's a generalized expression of my current beliefs:</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The scientific evidence will almost definitely pile up in favor of my simple, overarching theory that most people subconsciously misread my emotions because of my subtle facial injury that looks like a negative facial expression.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I have been investigating this matter in a disinterested, apolitical way for several years, and I will carry on until I can live with dignity and get treated with the basic respect that all people deserve.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Almost everyone I know is going sideways with regard to my beliefs about my life, and many people also have the private view that I'm delusional or blatantly wrong when I say my facial injury is preventing me from living with dignity.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Baring any unforeseen calamities, my methodical, scientific, and pragmatic approach to resolving this question will prevail, and I will reach a point of consensus with a decisive majority of all scientists who take the time to study the evidence about how my injury affects my life. But for what it's worth, my experience of dealing with this facial injury is an excellent case study in how culture can exert powerful biases in the minds of pretty much everyone. I have a front row seat to all the ways normal, good hearted people spin on the task of inventing false explanations for the phenomenon that's caused by my facial injury.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">When the simple truth is incongruent with the underlying assumptions at the root of mainstream culture, everyone feels inexorably compelled to keep on searching for false explanations instead of stepping out of line with culture and acknowledging the truth for what it is.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I wouldn't keep working on this problem if I had an easier way to live with dignity. It's an awkward irony that, in a mostly free society, the slippery slope of condemnation to life as a second class citizen, which, by definition, implies no protection against further downward mobility, is an extraordinary motivator to continue working against discouraging odds and extreme social rejection in order to avoid a permanent loss of agency.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Now is the time for people in situations like mine to keep working towards the right to live with equal dignity. The window of opportunity for me, personally, to escape a future life of unlimited forced submission to an unjust system is gradually closing, but the process of healthy, non-violent scientific exploration still has a lot to reveal, to us all, about the future.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="31637">29. Alternative Intro</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(November 2, CEO)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(ONE) I dreamt I was in a village where everyone was moving around using motorized computer desk chairs. I woke up wanting to put motorized wheels inside the base of high heel wedges. The drive wheel should be on the outside edge so you can point your feet outward, like a dancer going forward. Swivel wheels adorn the heel and the inside edge so you can lean onto the drive wheels and make gliding turns. Two stylish, touch sensitive rings to be worn on your index fingers control changes in velocity.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">It could be sexy and functional for Suzy to zoom around cities, airports, and offices at up to 10mph in these amazing shoes! I can't imagine tastemakers using powered roller skates, but shoes that look like a high heel platform wedges could work. The raised heel might help the customer move like a dancer and maintain balance, although that will need to be tested.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(TWO) I woke up in the morning reflecting on two ideas: hate is a bug, and most people are delusional, and then I put on the high heel wedges sitting by my bed, as if to remind me about the idea I had developed between 3:00am and 3:30am, and I glided towards a computer in the other room.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I must have thought a lot about how hate is a bug and how most people are delusional early in the 7th grade, which, to me, represents, more than anything else, the end of the 18 month period when I furiously learned to program computers in order to create my own video game.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I built my first game, I loved playing it, it won the 6th grade math fair, and then my motivation to follow through on a second game was not the same as when I had been learning to make the computer perform magic tricks for the first time.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">On any given day, I was procrastinating the work that needed to be done on my second game, by watching some cable TV series like, "The great leap forward of military technology during the great wars," and while I was 90% interested in learning about the technological advances in the design and implementation of weapons systems during the wars, as much as 10% of my brain cycles found a way to ask questions like, "Why did these wars happen?"</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">At that age, my final answer to that exam question, if you will, was, "The great wars were fueled by hatred, and the wars were stupid and unnecessary, and so, therefore, the capacity for humans to feel hate is like a software bug." Haha, I totally sailed through high school with pedantic drivel like that!  God I loved being a kid.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(THREE) The first meaningful life lesson I learned from programming was that you can easily spend two hours searching for a missing semi-colon, and there is no deeper meaning to that pain. The seemingly heroic quest, and it is heroic, is actually a waste of time.  The solution is to try harder to put the semi-colons in the right place early and often.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">If you can't get better at putting the semi-colons in the right places, then the time to market for your video game goes from 18 months to 10 years, and 10 years isn't fast enough.  It's like showing up to a tank battle with wooden spears. Heroism, alone, isn't going to cut it, because hate is a bug in the source code of human beings.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The idea that hate is a bug lead me down that path of assuming most people are delusional. Religion, and Christianity in particular, was exhibit A for why most people are delusional. It's blatantly obvious that whimsical troublemakers like myself authored the stories about Jesus without any supernatural intervention, and people who believe otherwise are stuck in an infinite loop of false hope that life will always be like a video game.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(FOUR) In the 5th grade, I wouldn't have had the intellectual confidence to say most adults are delusional, but by the 7th grade, I knew, for a fact, that most adults are delusional about how computers work. If adults were only delusional about religion, that could have been explained away as a bizarre anomaly of the mysterious adult world, but when so many adults were delusional about both religion and the inner workings of computers, it became reasonable for my younger self to conclude that many people are, quite simply, delusional, in general.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">My world view isn't all that different today, but it's misleading for me to write with the force of an adult about ideas that occurred to me as whimsical fantasies.  In the 7th grade, I would have expressed ideas like, "Hate is a bug," and, "Most people are delusional," as earnest, approval seeking stories.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Earnest, approval seeking stories were like the icing on the cake of video games that were mostly interesting because of their innovations in the simulation of virtual worlds. If I had tried to write these ideas down in a blog post like I'm doing right now, I would have framed the whole process as parody in a thousand little ways, and I would have written that way more out of habit than intention.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(FIVE) I like to believe satirical storytelling is the natural state for human expression. The art and science of serious writing is a deeply iterative process that's shamelessly and deceitfully disguised as a kind of whimsical expression.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">In reality, you should, of course, never admit that you've noticed this, but I'm writing this article in a way that sends signals to other adults that I can back stop what I'm saying, all the way, with politics, the law, and maybe even a total war in which the people who are on my side will win, unconditionally, even if, especially if, in fact, the war is, technically speaking, a failure for everyone. How do you like me now? Stay whimsical, my friends!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">And so, this morning, I have two new ideas. The first is my design for high heeled platform wedges. That idea simply would not and could not have occurred to me in the seventh grade.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">That is, I wanted to be more feminine back then, but I had no appreciation of style and fashion, sigh. I was still getting all my fashion sense from watching cable TV specials about war, and war is a very narrow source of inspiration for thinking about fashion.  Hehe.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(SIX) My other new idea is that Silicon Valley, and maybe the whole world is at an inflection point where we need to decide if we want to build computers in our image or if we want to make some fundamental changes to our design, as humans. I see so many people around Silicon Valley these days projecting dogmatic faith that anything and everything that human beings do is naturally is good, and I think that's dangerous.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(SEVEN) If hate is a part of the source code of human beings, then maybe we should remove that feature when we build machines in our likeness, but right now, the status quo in the increasingly global economic monoculture is to keep that feature, not by choice, but rather by shamelessly and deceitfully burying it under layers of data science and mission statements that are mysteriously consistent with all this the narrow minded loose talk about how empathy and authenticity are truer than whatever else might represent belief in God.  Everything else, including my identity, is now being framed as suspicious.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(BUT) Silicon Valley, and maybe the whole world, for that matter, was never a place that proved willing, or even able, to follow the status quo to its logical ends, and so I remain hopeful for a better future.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="31661">30.

All character traits are essentially variations on wearing a funky hat.

Other examples of traits include hiring a videographer, carrying a cup of fruit to a barbecue at a frat house, wearing all pink, driving to the beach in a red convertible, and getting spanked on your birthday, on stage, in front of an audience.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="29389">mSuzy</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Oh my!</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="37132">Auth</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Character traits always exist in a context.

My hypothesis is that this iterative process of stimulus and response was the driving force that caused Suzy's brain to develop a natural ability to imitate neurotypicals.
