Raleigh was also a contemporary of a famous bard named Will Shakespeare.  But here's the really unlikely part, I grew up in North Carolina.  Is this a coincidence?  We think not.  Everything's connected by the treasure map of culture.  Our show's orgasmic "Ode to Joy" is the idea that a (SEXY mRyzus) a lose thread, begin pulled, out of a tight sweater, that flatters the figure, of a sensual British pirate, is sufficient, for unraveling, most of the dirty laundry, that's lurking underneath, the metaphorical mattress, of what I like to call, the global economic system.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="414">Austhain</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">British pirates symbolize rockstars at the height of the British invasion, right?

(POINTS BACK AND FORTH)  If Shakespeare is Christianity 2.0, you can engineer a Shakespeare 2.0 meme for the post-gunman era.  I dig it.  Just make sure you don't mess with my culture.
