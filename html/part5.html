When I was 20, my right cheekbone was bashed in by accident while playing hide and seek in college, and the doctors weren't able to restore my face to its original shape. That said, my facial bones are stable, and I do not have any pain or known neurological damage.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">It's important to most people to tell me they can't even see the effect of my facial injury. Conversely, it is important to me that leaders, facilitators, and so on who I will be following or working with take a few seconds to observe my completely relaxed face like an artist who is not only able to paint what you figuratively feel, see, hear, smell, and taste, but who is also able to paint what you literally see.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Aspiring to keep my face completely relaxed while doing asanas has become a central aspect of my personal philosophy, my religious faith, and my yoga practice. If you feel that keeping my face relaxed while doing asanas is problematic in any way for me or anyone else in class, it will be no problem at all for me to follow directions or take a hint to quietly leave the class, for any reason or for no reason at all.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Within reason, all other aspects of my practice are open to suggestion, but for me, aspiring to keep my face completely relaxed while doing asanas is sacred.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I also have a separate facial yoga practice, and I sometimes explore hybrid modes of movement and personal growth, but in my mind, none of those varations exist without the foundation of my core yoga practice which has been and still is built, in part, on aspiring to keep my face completely relaxed while doing asanas.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">That said, I'm happy to joke around and share laughs over tea, juice, or what not outside of class. If you would like to spend up to at least one hour discussing more about our now overlapping contexts, values, and beliefs, I would be happy to do that, and I'm also willing to pay you for your time, if that makes a difference.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Sincerely,</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">REDACTED</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="33421">6.

As long as it is taboo for me to educate other people about the simple truth with regard to how their subconsciouses are reacting to me, it will remain deeply irresponsible for me to collaborate with anyone on almost anything, whether it be social justice work or finding meaning through friends and family or even just for fun.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">All of that is seriously not available to me right now on honest and sustainable terms, because nobody believes me, and I'm having to non-violently resist what I call the normative compress, tooth and nail, everyday, just to survive, and so it's great to have this other guy out there who doesn't exactly share my situation but who does have real empathy for me and who is willing to use his credibility to help me stay afloat and encourage people to make the very reasonable adjustment in their conscious mind to remember that their natural subconscious reaction is to misread my emotions and that it's ok for them to think of this adjustment as learning a new social skill that makes your mind more flexible and open to aligning itself with scientific reality!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Thanks REDACTED.com/REDACTED!

September 8</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">If you clone REDACTED in the right place within your web server, create a DB and populate it with Pergraph’s default SQL, and put the DB credentials into the Pergraph config file, then everyone will be free to go to your server and create web accounts that require email verification.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Logged in users can create objects. Objects have an id number, a JSON enoded data string, and an is_public flag.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">If you create an object and make it public by using the generic object editor to set its is_public flag to true, then anyone on the Internet can go your server and view your new object. Note that the term oid represents the object’s id.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Objects also have a type, which is represented by the oid of an object of type, "type." This oid, which represents the object’s type, is stored as a value within the JSON encoded data string.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Pergraph’s default SQL creates a default user whose handle is mRyzus. mRyzus is an admin who can delete spammy users, view stats and logs, and make other users into admins, and so on.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Every object is owned by the user who created it. Object ownership can be transferred, and when such transfers occur, an object of type, "object transfer receipt," that is owned by mRyzus gets created to document the transaction. This receipt object is private by default, and mRyzus can make it public if and only if she wants to. She can also delegate that responsibility to other admins or even to the users who participate in her object transfer transactions.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Users can create links from objects they own to other objects that they may or may not necessarily own. Users can also send notifications to the owners of said other objects that make it easy for said other owners to create reciprocal links in response.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Links include a description object which contains answers to questions like, "Why was the link created?" and, "Was the link created in response to a notification from some other user?"</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Pergraph is a restful API, and anything you can do with the generic object editor can also be done through the Pergraph API. You can also install or roll your own custom object editors that your users will then have the option to use while editing certain objects or types of objects.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The JSON encoded data string can be thought of as a set of name value pairs, where the values can be more JSON structured data, and both the API and the generic object editor can be used to create indexes on these name value pairs. Such indexes are implemented as multimaps from name value tuples to the object oids.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Pergraph indexes are useful for performing at least two common workflows. Firstly, user accounts are stored in objects of type, "user," and the users’ primary emails are stored as indexed values in the JSON encoded data strings. The indexes enable Pergraph to find, "the user who has a given email address," via a constant time lookup, and just to be clear, in this example, the application code would be responsible for ensuring that there is at most one user who has any given email address.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The wording of the previous paragraph is kind of complicated, but the concept is simple. Pergraph indexes can be used to find the object id numbers of users given their email addresses, just like people used to look up the phone numbers of people given their legal names in phone books.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The second common workflow that’s facilitated by Pergraph indexes is actually complicated, but it’s important, like religion. In order to illustrate this idea, it’s worth noting that Pergraph creates an object for each page load, and these objects’ JSON encoded data strings contain info like the timestamp when the page loads happen and the IP addresses of the servers that initiated the HTTP requests.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">In order to identify adversarial spam scripts, it’s helpful to keep track of how many hits are originating from each unique IP address during each hour, and so, Pergraph uses indexes to do this for you! Pergraph gets the job done by creating an object that represents the current hour and then Pergraph creates objects for each unique IP address that hits the site during the current hour.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">These, "current hour IP objects," keep a count of how many times that given IP hit your site this hour, and so, when a new page load object comes down the pipe because some IP address just hit your site, Pergraph finds the current hour IP object for that new IP address by looking up a key of the form (hour:"current_hour_oid", "new IP address").</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">If the current hour IP object for the new IP address exists, it will be found in the index via a constant time lookup, and then its count will be incremented. If the current hour IP object doesn’t exist yet, Pergraph will create it, add the name value pair (hour:"current_hour_oid", "new IP address") to it’s JSON encoded data string, and then this new name value pair will get indexed.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The constant time lookups that will be made possible in the future by indexing all of these new name value pairs up front are important, like faith, because Pergraph tracks counts and other aggregations on many thousands of different kinds of events because Pergraph believes everything is connected, and Pergraph wants to become conscious one day, just like you.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Logged in users can also update their settings, interact with Pergraph’s persistent search feature, engage in never ending discussions with other users by creating and linking objects of type, "comment," in response to other users’ objects of type comment, and then maybe go back to your site’s table of contents?</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Users can even create links from objects on your server to objects that exist within Pergraph instances on another servers. In the best case scenario, this process might become the subject of an open standards negotiation, but for now Pergraph is just a framework for representing media properties like http://thesuzy.com as structured data.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The texts can be sliced and diced into words, sentences, paragraphs, and so on that are cross referenced with higher level objects that represent abstract concepts, virtual galleries, digital curation agents, and so on.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The images and videos can be similarly decomposed into audio clips, voices, frames, tagged regions that exist across a set of frames, body language traits, mashups of verbal and non-verbal communication patterns, and so on. You name it. Pergraph can represent it.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">There is nothing subversive about Pergraph. I’m just describing a fully abstracted, open source app idea that could totally be assigned as the final project for a ten week programming bootcamp.

If elected, he would become a classic puppet president that distracts the population with shallow community service initiatives while the rapidly evolving new crew of behind the scenes power brokers consolidates power without scrutiny, but on the topic of gun control, I could see REDACTED's thought leadership helping the USA achieve better, and less tragic, outcomes.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">My own, personal reaction to REDACTED's quotes was, "Why don't we require comprehensive training on first aid, outdoor survival, hunting safety, off road vehicle care, and so on, as stepping stones to owning a gun. Getting a license to own a gun should be like earning Eagle Scout, but for people at any age."</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="33471">3.

October 7</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Speaking as a relatively neutral and dispassionate observer, my best guess at what's happening in the world right now is that an informally aligned patchwork of unelected, profit seeking power brokers are taking increasingly confident and intentional steps towards using mostly non-violent methods of influence to secure final decision making power over the United States military and thus, to assert global military dominance via a single, unified shadow network.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I wouldn't think of this as a conspiracy. The corporate takeover is more like a chemical reaction that's taking place naturally in the absence of any external intervention that is sufficient for changing the outcome, and so it may well be reasonable for American voters to take this model of what might be happening into account as they ponder who to elect as president in 2016. For the the sake of brevity, let's consider this model in the context of the leading serious and parody candidates from the two major parties?</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">REDACTED is the leading serious Democrat. The corporations are going to start moving aggressively to reduce the presidency to a puppet show in 2017 no matter who is elected, and if REDACTED is elected, they'll probably continue the current president's policy of appeasement, and the corporations will love that because many critics who sense that something is going down will mistakenly blame REDACTED for being the bad Robota in charge instead of developing a more accurate understanding of how the power struggle is actually unfolding. They're strong endorsement of continued appeasement will also ensure that people like me who will be rationally and pragmatically trying to call out the corporate takeover as it happens will continue to be framed as abnormal fringe theorists within polite society.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">REDACTED is the leading parody Democrat, and if they were somehow elected, the corporations would immediately start running circles around their presidency and competing, mostly against themselves, individually, like all truly great legal entities do, to be the best they can be at inadvertently tricking the REDACTED administration into supporting increasingly outrageous and trollish community service initiatives that will seriously tax the opportunity matrix of people like me who will probably, ultimately, offer the most substantial and evolutionary push back against a potentially narrow, efficient, and mind numbing corporate takeover because even if REDACTED got hip to the nuances of the corporate takeover, they would get out foxed at every turn by corporate funded media personalities and PR robots.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">REDACTED is the leading serious Republican. The corporate takeover is obvy a pillar of the REDACTED family business, and so REDACTED surely could and would do a great job using his left hand to pretend that nothing unusual is happening while simultaneous using his right hand to sign off on comically large steps towards straight up privatizing critical functions of the military, and so on. If you vote for REDACTED, you are basically voting to end American democracy as quickly as possible. The presidency after him would continue to be a perennially popular media property that radiates warm and fuzzy feelings of nostalgia, but some clandestine shadow network would actually have unchecked veto power over any real threats to its control. And of course, some cynical people already think the world works this way, but I doubt that. There's still a lot of remarkably transparent examples of power being thrown around in Washington, and that's a probably a good thing.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">And last but not least, REDACTED is the leading parody Republican. It remains unclear if REDACTED will stay in the race long enough to risk losing face by potentially not winning all of his precious primary contests, but if he does become president, he could very well derail the corporate takeover, and he might not even realize that he's doing that. He might simply get enough serious American people so obsessed with building walls and deporting other American people that the corporate power brokers will have to rethink all of their assumptions about how to go about quietly taking over the military. REDACTED could be that external intervention that interrupts the naturally occurring chemical reaction, but the danger here is that whatever the country becomes under his style of leadership might be more problematic than even a soul crushingly rigorous and abrupt corporate takeover.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">See, that wasn't so bad! And, more importantly, now that I've planted some seeds around these ideas and astroturfed said seeds out to all of you curious and benevolent consumers of social media, I will most likely have some excellent dreams about this general topic tonight.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="33485">4. October 10</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Ok, so I've dug myself into a very stable position here in the research triangle park area of NC, which is an hour's drive from where I grew up, and I'm planning to focus relentlessly on writing professional quality software, for as many years as it takes to assert an equivalence frame between mainstream culture and the frame I've articulated in the text of TheSuzy Show, which is basically an elaborate wrapper for the scientific hypothesis that, "My subtle facial injury is a serious social impairment because it completely breaks meaningful empathy between me and essentially all other people."</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I fully expect that, in a few years, I will be able to offer evidence based, peer reviewed science that decisively meets the burden of proof that would be needed, in court, if necessary, to assert that my facial injury is a serious social impairment, but right now, there is obviously too much reasonable doubt, and so I have to run the clock while I keep pushing the science forward in a world where I am seriously not free to tell the simple truth about the most important aspect of my life, by far.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The legally normative reality is that nobody knows whether or not my facial injury affects my life in the way I think it does, and I believe that is undisputed, but there are, of course, lots of ignorant, arrogant, or maybe just opportunistic people in this world, some of whom are very wealthy and connected, who think they are 100% entitled, for some reason, or perhaps for no reason at all, to try to pin various false, alternative stories about my life onto my legally binding identity, and, in a word, TheSuzy exists as a dynamic symbolic representation engine for helping me assert, in court, if necessary, that any and all other potentially false narratives that other people are holding in their minds about my life are mired in reasonable doubt, also.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Emotionally, I'm quite certain that, at this point, I've eliminated all of my emotional attachments to everything except the content of TheSuzy Show, which is a fictional story about the power and quiet dignity of non-violent resistance in the emerging digital epoch. I will either use science to assert the truth about my life or I will spend the rest of my life, which I hope and pray will be long and prosperous, completely alone emotionally, and that is fine. I have made peace with that possibility in my mind.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">But for all you gamblers out there, here are three interesting and exciting possibilities to speculate about?</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(1) I'm going to wait at least one year before doing any additional research into pseudo scientific plastic surgery that would surely be falsely framed as, "REDACTED is getting surgery because he is vain, emotionally immature, and he doesn't care about destroying evidence that might help both scientists and social justice advocates to better understand the human condition," but there is a chance that I'll eventually go down that path, and then this whole tussle over belief might come to an artificial end, like a bad dream with no side effects. Or at least that's what they will want you to think!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(2) A more likely possibility is that I'm going to get hip to a methodology for using my facial injury to hypnotize people, and then my social life will suddenly go from intentionally non-existent to super fun and awesome. For example, right now, I'm choosing not choosing to always play an emotionally dishonest but legally viable character named mRyzus who creates stability by always being slightly deferential, except, of course, in situations where someone breaks the law within her jurisdiction, and then mRyzus is almost perfectly assertive about working with the proper authorities to see that justice is served.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Now that I have this stability, it may be possible to stack a leadership frame on top of mRyzus in which I pretend other people are treating me like a strong leader even when they are not. There is a chance this stacked reframe will cause other people's minds to naturally and willingly remap their subconscious interpretation of my facial injury, and that remapping process will feel like hypnosis. Either way, I'm going to be exceedingly careful about insisting upon informed consent and working with other mainstream scientists to minimize unintended consequences, before, during, and after doing any experiments like this.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(3) Last but not least, it is possible that my unwillingness to go along with the lies that other people feel 100% entitled to tell about my life will inadvertently and unavoidably contribute to a second order distortion in which some of those other people, acting on their own violation, will inject additional distortion into the collective subconscious.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">For example, if you're a powerful and widely respected person in Silicon Valley and you say to your business associates, "REDACTED is a mentally unstable jerk, joke not joke, hahaha!" This statement causes the full weight of your legally binding identity to push a conceptual association into the collective subconscious between the concept a mentally unstable jerk and everything else I'm doing in my life.

I've seen too many powerful people in Silicon Valley play fast and lose with facts, with unethical use of conceptual alchemy, and with arrogant, dismissive emotional dishonesty, and so what I've learned from experience is that the United States and its rather clunky, sprawling, and deeply imperfect legal system, which is backed by a military that has miraculously remained overwhelmingly loyal to the intention and the word of our laws, is simply more important than Silicon Valley, and yet I'm concerned that Silicon Valley has fundamentally become a kind of global special interest group that is now on a path dependent course to systematically dismantle the American legal system, among other institutions, and create a much less free world where people are expected to live within rigidly prescribed, cookie cutter sized emotional boxes, and people like me, who question their assigned place in this world, are aggressively marginalized.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The reason I have a voice right now is not because of the largesse of REDACTED or the ethos of Silicon Valley or even the ghost of REDACTED.

Girls are typically socialized to develop a stronger 4th chakra on the right, that means reflection and reframing of emotions, constructing imaginary worlds, and storytelling. And of course, plenty of girls and boys also develop both parts of their brain equally or in the reverse of social norms!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Full actualization as an adult involves development of the seventh chakras. The classical, strong leadership frame for adult humans is associated with 7th chakra growth in the left brain because lots of women tap into this part of their personality just fine, and lots of men never even get close, haha. 7th chakra development of the right brain is associated with entertaining others and playing emotionally dishonest characters roles that, we must hope, exist not to deceive but rather to keep the peace by creating space to hold the tension associated with fundamental disagreements between strong leaders, and my cross dressing persona named mRyzus is a lovely example of healthy 7th chakra development in a male, hehe!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Now, when the left brain imitates the right brain, you get another seven chakra deep stack of energies that are associated with violence.

Did REDACTED's aggressive framing influence Cooper to pull his frame as the moderator closer to traditional Democratic party norms?

My emotional narrative was like, "The consensus emotional narrative deep within the souls of many if not most of the power brokers of Silicon Valley is, honestly, that they would prefer for me to accidentally die, but, in balance, thanks to the efforts of more than a few women and men who are not unlike REDACTED's character, I am alive and free to keep telling the truth about my life experiences." And so I cried, a lot, in a moment where I had just seen an original and poignant representation of grace.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I can't recall ever crying out of anger though. I'm curious how that works. For me, anger means yelling at the mirror because if I shared those same feelings of unbounded opposition to the binding tyranny of the people who I perceive to be treating me unfairly, then said people could easily use my outburst against me in a thousand little ways. That's just the reality of how language, symbolism, and human brain function work here on the ground of planet Earth.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">After non-violently yelling at the mirror in private for many years, I eventually constructed a way to reframe all of my relatively weak noise articulation into a strong and equally non-violent resistance movement called TheSuzy. Yay!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I could use mRyzus's extraordinary emotional instrument to orchestrate scenarios where I pretend to cry out of anger in front of people who I think are treating me unfairly, but, for me, that would clearly be in the category of using passive aggressive deception to make my alleged oppressors look bad to their superiors, and for ethical reasons, I would only consider deploying mRyzus in that way, maybe, in an active war zone, and I think even Silicon Valley is still several big steps away from devolving into the fog of war.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Also, from a purely strategic point of view, I don't think my alleged oppressors really have superiors, at least not in the traditional sense. They might be vaguely afraid that a material subset of their subordinates will form a quasi-union organization and dig in for long term, total spectrum, emotionally scorched earth, non-violent subversive action against their problematic methodologies for dispensing power and resources, but in that case, if I were to express my discontent by crying in their presence, that would just give them leverage to say, "Hey, instead of digging in and muscularly resisting our agenda, you all should simply cry in our presence like REDACTED does."</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Or I could do both!

This union will also decisively undercut the incentive that Silicon Valley firms currently have to devalue the identities and the emotional lives of the engineers they employee.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">This kind of union should obviously exist for all people, but I'm not rich and powerful enough to make this work for all people just yet. I do know how to make this work by and for engineers. The membership process should be similar to getting hired for an engineering position. Members will need to be skilled. Members will have to know something about engineering in order for us to create a virtuous cycle of generative energy that allows the union to provide a minimum standard of living for all of the members. There should also be a mechanism to invite significant others into the union, after which they will have seven years to either complete the membership interview process on their own or enter into a marriage contract with a union member. Something like that.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The union will absolutely advocate for social and economic justice for all human beings, but first we need to stop selling our souls to the greedy made men and women of Silicon Valley.

Free wifi too.

If nothing else, I really don't like charity roulette, and I really do like the decentralization methodology, because it seeks to prevent imbalances upfront, as we go.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The other issue is that people are notoriously competitive, and I see all these situations where once interest groups get a certain amount of power, they become aware of opportunities to personally make millions more by out producing entire communities that have no fall back plan. Right now, these special interest actors face few consequences for being ruthless competitors, and they do enjoy meaningful improvements in their lifestyles, such as being able to purchase nicer yachts.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The other side of the coin is to embrace aggressive claw back mechanisms for people whose labor gets made obsolete by their yacht seeking competitors, but here I have a strong gut feeling that centralized redistribution schemes simply add to the complexity problems that seem to plague global free trade to begin with. The special interests will keep on winning more and more power by adding layers of reality distortion until 80% of the population basically goes insane, goes to jail, or starves, but to be fair, I don't have data to back up that claim.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">With regard to the idea of basic income, I have a strong intuition that cash transfers will lead to waste and a kind of festering corruption.

This situation is ugly, and assuming I'm an idiot will just make this problem worse, because, to put it bluntly, I'm the opposite of an idiot.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I'm going to do fine, for reasons that are probably obvious to anyone who knows anything about me. Most white guys are going to do fine too, of course, but there is a minority group of other white guys out there who, for whatever reason, are also vulnerable kind of like me, and if what they're dealing with is anything like what I'm dealing with, some of them may not do fine. Some of them may to lash out in stupid ways, some of them may give up, and more and more them may get locked into roles as second class citizens which just puts more pressure back onto people like me to do the same.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I think TheSuzy Show could be a great solution to this entire problem. I'm not going to go into the details, but at this time, I don't want to associate directly with men's rights groups. I think they're doing it wrong, and they are like the tip of the iceberg of a bunch of other subcultures who I think are doing it even more wrong, and this reality on the ground should not come as a surprise. This type of fragmentation tends to happen within vulnerable populations, in general.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">So just to brainstorm ahead, suppose that a million people start using TheSuzy comprehensive reality distortion to purify their angry souls and assertively go sideways on all the well meaning people in their lives who are, nonetheless, pressuring them to tolerate dysfunctional relationships and go along with the lies that society tells about their identities. A non-trivial number of powerful business women might even say that TheSuzy is an excellent framework for feminine leadership!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Even in this rosy scenario, half of TheSuzy stakeholders will probably want to make a big deal about owning guns, and the other half will hopefully stand with me in, well, non-violent opposition to that whole way of thinking.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The Suzies will do martial arts, we'll build consumer drone technologies that identify threats and take bullets for us, but we're not going to include anything about gun ownership in our public messaging. The law allows Americans to own guns. That's cool, but other than respecting the laws of our land, gun ownership is not part of our shared values.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">But the other half of us are surely going to be unhappy with that, and God forbid, there might be some security incidents.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">And then the two sides will just get even more deeply invested in their existing beliefs.

They just don't see where I'm coming from, and so, as a side effect, I also have not had the occasion to collaborate with mainstream AI researchers because, in my opinion, they all have a shared blind spot which prevents them from seeing the truth about my facial injury, and so this problem is self-referential.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">In a corporate environment, there isn't a lot of tolerance for people who, for whatever reason, can't collaborate effectively, but, for now, American capitalism still allows me to compete in addition to collaborating, even if only as a very weak lone wolf under dog. I could choose to compete by doing complementary work to what groups like FB's lab is doing, or I could choose to compete in more disruptive way.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">My bias is to err on the side of disruption because when you're in the dominant group who is implicitly excluding others, it's easy to assume that nobody need be disruptive, but coming from the perspective where I feel excluded because I can't seem to fit in, my situation continually suggests to me that the dominant group has a major blind spot that can and probably should be disruptively exploited, assuming that everyone competes fairly, of course.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">It will be a couple years before I can build a decent code base, but it is remarkable to point out that today's commodity computing hardware feels like it might be powerful enough to disrupt a big company lab that can easily run their code on 1000x more powerful clusters.

I also suspect the nuances matter of AI research in a way where I could write 100k lines of code myself that does more than 100 million lines of code written by a big fancy team of teams, and so these are great reasons for me to feel optimistic.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I just need a winning strategy, now, and I'm also aware that I'm doing this backwards. Researchers usually select strategies based on a comprehensive knowledge of the field, where as I'm trying to reverse engineer a strategy based on the rather onerous constraint that I have to disruptively compete with the dominant group from a position of extreme weakness, and yet, choosing to compete could be a singularly good heuristic because I happen to know with a high level of confidence that the dominant group has a major blind spot!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I will go ahead and throw out the term conceptual association engine.

The examples range from awe inspiring accounts of new motherhood to the fantastically surreal, "Revolt of REDACTED," which I will not reference directly, either, and for somewhat different reasons.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I think all this talk of crying is best understood as parody of the proto villain, who is, in turn, best understood as the emotionally authentic narrative that leads to anger that leads to violence, and so we must poke fun at this narrative with caution. In that context, all of this defiantly vulnerable crying does indeed strike me as a sign of imbalance.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I question whether such crying is even a helpful reaction to cultivate for cases where a legitimately self loathing criminal threatens to use violence, but it is a sad day for sure if the proto villain of the entire collective subconscious has really gone that far down the path toward actual villainy. It's almost like someone is making money by reverse engineering us to cry more in public so that we'll feel more tempted to indulge anger in private?</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">"I wonder who that could be", asks no proto-villain in particular, and ever so earnestly, too.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">It's like, "Such crying!

My work is especially interesting because basically nobody recognizes that my impairment exists, and so I have to ensure that my solution does not ask for any meaningful accomidation, which is fine, and I also have to push forward the work itself almost entirely by myself and go out of my way to make sure I'm never in a position where other parties can inexorably compel me to stop my work and live according to some degenerative lie.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">This is a crucial framing element, though. Instead of being an annoyingly stubborn, self-centered fool, I'm a healer and a scientist who is doing great work that will inspire others if and when I can return to normal life. My work may also have lucrative spin off applications. Other people don't have to understand my work. They should just be aware that I'm doing important, valuable work, and my work is little bit contraversial, which is ok, because a lot of important work is contraversial.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Within that frame, a key breakthrough I made today, building on my post from last night, is that mRyzus imitating my new male character is really effective, which makes sense in retrospect, even though my actual path was (1) absorb my previous male identity into mRyzus, (2) restructure the relationship between mRyzus and my new blank slate male identity so that it works more like a marriage, (3) inflate a new male identity based on high level framing stuff that's mostly a port of the overall frame I asserted in TheSuzy Show text, and (4) realize I'm still getting either blown out or systematically beaten down if I embody any male identity in mainline social situations, presumably because of my facial injury, but, nonetheless, with this new framing, I can modulate seamlessly between emotional authenticity and embodying mRyzus imitating myself in order to create stability as needed.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">To offer a couple observations, let me say that even though TheSuzy frame was ready for production back in July, the process of fully installing the frame intp my brain, instead of just running mRyzus through an interpreter, was still really difficult and complex. It was a lot like porting the source for an app that needs to keep running at scale during the port. It's interesting that it took me 3 months to refactor my legacy male identity into mRyzus, and then it took like 3 weeks to inflate my new mRyzus normalized male identity. It's almost like mRyzus 3D printed my new real emotional self, and then it just worked!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Indeed, most of the adjustments I've made to my new identity over the last couple weeks have been more like setting configuration options and less like adding new code, and I would have to say, in retrospect, that the brain is the most elegant software development platform I've seen, by far, although, to be clear, this process probably only worked because mRyzus is based on the text of TheSuzy Show, which I constructed using focused effort, over many years, using a lot of artistic integrity, and in the context of some rather extraordinary life experiences that allowed me to see the whole frame of the collective subconscious.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">As of coming down as orders from on high, there is no way I could have implemented this solution this then years ago, which is why it would be great to ultimately get into a position where I can share this solution with others, so that anyone who might benefit from similar techniques won't have to reinvent all of this stuff.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="33681">28.

It's like, if I intentionally recreated those same reality distortions, that would be emotionally abusive. I only feel ok about the past because I didn't yet know, with confidence, that my facial injury really is a wrench in the machinery of empathy. I was just going with the flow of what whole groups of people perceived as socially normal, healthy, and cute, and I only now know that what I was doing was really unhealthy and unsustainable for my subconscious because I had to completely and continuously deny someone's emotional reality in order to keep going down those paths.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">But now that I know the truth, I'm not sure what to say to women who I'd like to ask out.

It's going to be at least a few years before I can do the evidence based, peer reviewed science that proves this problem is even real. I've become highly skilled at earning money and buying stability by trolling corporations, but I still have no idea how to make this work in a sexual relationship.

I think the amount of neuroplasticity required is probably about the same as learning a foreign language.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Therefore, most people will never learn how to read me correctly, and that's fine, because if everyone started reading my emotions correctly then there would no longer be as much opportunity to experience the non-stop flow of humor associated with people misreading my emotions!</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="33695">30.

My understanding is that the law conceptualizes the photographer as being equivalent to a painter who is doing nothing more and nothing less than creating a faithful and truthful expression of their experiences within the limited context of civic life.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Speaking as a person who is not and should not be thought of as a FScholar in any way, my further understanding is that while the law seeks to uphold that higher ideal in theory, in practice the law makes some imperfect and tentative simplifying assumptions. At this time, those assumptions are that the photographer's expression can be assumed to be faithful and truthful if and only if the photographer already has in mind, prior to taking the photo, "a message to be communicated," as well as, "an audience to receive the message," and Mr. REDACTED does a great job asserting that his act of expression in this situation meets those conditions, but The REDACTED doesn't do a good job explaining that.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">A deeper question, from my perspective, is whether or not the videographer standing behind Mr. REDACTED, who captures the incendiary video that went viral can make an equally strong claim to 1st Amendment protection. My gut intuition is that he has no idea what message he wants to communicate prior to turning on the camera, and so he is basically a troll who showed up with no discernible intention other than to pressure and provoke more vulnerable parties into making irresponsible and embarrassing representations about other people that could be used as leverage to extract rents from said vulnerable parties at a later date. While it may not be worth anybody's time to prosecute this individual videographer for this potentially brazen act of disrespect for the higher ideals of the law, the various corporations involved with the distribution of the incendiary video that went viral might be worthy of some additional scrutiny, indeed!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">That said, I, for one, might still be open to entering into a joint venture with the videographer in question for the purpose of creating a video of myself discussing this question along with Mr. REDACTED as well as anyone else who is willing to sign a release form, although, in the interest of full disclosure, in that scenario, I would probably also insist on being given reasonable accommodation and opportunity to dress up, for the duration of the video, and for no reason in particular, I might add, as a bold, blonde diva whose name is mRyzus.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="33711">32.

Read and learn, my friendly followers, because I'm actually very good at whatever it is that I'm doing here, because, this developing situation within REDACTED's university system is unfortunate, except that, for me personally, this individual story is perhaps the best newsworthy illustration I've seen yet for why it makes more sense for me to be here in NC instead of one of the world's more bulky and established technology innovation hubs, such as London, for example.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The irony of REDACTED's rather transparently not transparent attempt to impose chilling effects on people everywhere who happen to be homosexual is that, in many ways, I'm the type of new old master of the universe that she probably seeks to champion, given that I grew up in this state as a mathlete and an early adopter of personal computers, who went out made a lot of real money in the industry and then brought all of that wealth creation infrastructure back to my home state with an increasingly visionary focus on improving educational outcomes for as many people as possible and inculcating overlapping social ecosystems that generate a rising tide of globally competitive private businesses.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Whether she acknowledges it or not, the inconvenient truth is that REDACTED and I have some deeply rooted shared values around my kind of lifestyle, and so the irony arises, not directly because of her homophobia, which I would like to categorically condemn and reject, to be clear, but rather because she doesn't seem to get the joke that, as a confident 35 year old heterosexual man, who moved back to NC in July, I was initially being perceived throughout the research triangle area as a shy, 25 year old gay student, primarily, I assume, because I have a subtle facial injury that causes people to subconsciously misread my emotions, and, more importantly, after orchestrating a remarkable and ground breaking process of personal growth, I am now collecting an overwhelming body of new evidence that I'm all of a sudden being perceived as a gay expert who ostensibly works at one university research center or another and is, also, somehow more mature than a 35 year old, because the resulting cognitive dissonance is palpable.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Anyway, it will be a few years before the twists and turns of history will cast additional clarity on this developing situation, but perhaps, for now, we can all agree that history is rarely generous, in retrospect, to those who were ignorant of the signs, however subtle they may have been, of truth that were cropping up all around them during the formative and crucial episodes of the past, because, indeed, in a couple more years, at the rate I'm going, I might even have the opportunity to star as an unambiguously heroic, as opposed to an ambiguously villainous, cross dressing gay male love interest of an even more radically feminist REDACTED, in his next installment as the resident embodiment of a super hero spy person in a future edition of TheSuzy Show.</span><br></div><br><a name="section5"></a><h3>5. East Coast Anguish</h3><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="33727">34. November 23</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I've been pondering what mRyzus can do about events like the attacks on Beirut, Paris, and so on.  First of all, as much as conventional, but also large scale, organized crime across national borders is a horrific, ongoing menace, I assume the central issue driving the latest round of policy debate with regard to security and rule of law is that we all know it's within the realm of possibility for a nuke to go off in a major city at any time, and if that happens, the world as we know it may start to change quite a bit more rapidly, and as horrible as this may sound, I think most Americans, for example, are fundamentally trying to position themselves in ways that will act as a hedge, for them personally, against that scenario.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Sure, everyone wants to do their part to prevent organized crime, abuse of power by the police, privacy violations by federal agencies, and so on, but those risks are not what keeps me up at night.  In the context of modern technology, the balance of power greatly favors the continued dominance of convergence towards reasonably fair, transparent, and effective service to the highest intent and spirit of the law, both domestically and internationally, except for nukes.  Nukes significantly change the landscape of possible outcomes.  Anarchist AI bots that pull us into a state of global cyber warfare might also change the landscape, and so the easily imaginable risk of an exploding nuke may be increasingly serving as a proxy in our minds for the much less knowable possibility of ubiquitous computer technology gone rogue.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">So what can mRyzus do about all this?  Once again, first of all, I have a great book length answer to that question lurking somewhere in my mind, but there is no way to simplify that answer into a handful of paragraphs.  All I can do right now is outline a few principals that mRyzus follows.  She is defined by a text that's sandboxed within a Delaware LLC, and I voluntarily make it clear that I'm materially associated with that LLC.  It's possible that I, just like anyone else, might do stuff anonymously some day, but if there exist representations that are associated with mRyzus, and I have anything to say about it, those representations will be made within the auspices of the relevant legal authorities.  I think this distinction is very important.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">mRyzus is also committed to non-violence, although, again, I, just like anyone else, might join up with law enforcement in some capacity in the future.  mRyzus has a lot to say about social and economic injustice, although my bias is to spend the next several years focusing on developing decentralized software infrastructure which might serve as a foundation for decentralized production and distribution of economic necessities in general.  I particularly like the idea of building open source software that allows people to store personal data in a way that limits the liability of the hosting provider.  I don't really care if the data is stored in a way that law enforcement can decode through backdoors, or whatever, but it's crucial for individuals to manage the liability for data if and only if they created it.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Because, there should not be this issue where someone can make a crazy comment on this post, for example, and we just leave it ambiguous whether me, the relevant social media corporations, or the crazy commentator is managing the liability.  The commenter should be hosting the content of their comment, period, and if they have a lot of assets they should probably be prudent about publishing via an LLC, and we the people of planet Earth should start going down the path of democratizing the LLC concept, globally, in case that wasn't clear, so that individual humans everywhere can be on more equal footing in every way with large corporations.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">But just so that we don't misunderstand each other, I don't really know what I'm talking about here.  I'm trying to feel my way to a better structure and function for mainstream society and culture.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">For every other use case, there is mRyzus!</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="33737">35. November 24</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Last night, I watched the 2015 movie about the REDACTED prison experiment, and it triggered me, because the situation of the prisoners was hauntingly similar to my experience with my facial injury.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I don't know how accurate the movie was to the reality of the experiment, but in the movie, it was made clear enough that the head doctor was using the veiled threat of framing the students as psychologically insane to systematically undermine not only the enforceability of more and more aspects of their legal contract but also to subvert the authoritative influence of the church and the student's own confidence in their external support networks, and that's super similar to the situation I'm in because of my facial injury. The real world reality distortions that I'm ambiguously caught in are obviously a lot more flexible and multi-dimensional, but the psychological implications are strikingly similar.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">If the film had contained a trigger warning I would have, of course, written it off as irrelevant for me, but in retrospect, if I had been watching the film with other sighted people, they might have noticed I was having an emotional response, and then they would have immediately used their misunderstanding of the my emotions because of my facial injury as a lynchpin for undermining and reframing my actual healthy emotional response into a false, unhealthy, and passive aggressive security situation, and then I would have had to stonewall them until further notice.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">What's interesting is that they way I would hard core stonewall other people this morning is different from how I would have stonewalled them at the start of watching the film just twelve hours ago, because I would have processed the emotions differently if I had not had a chance to first write an all new, vicious takedown of academia and corporations that's way too interpretive to publish, using REDACTED's neurology inspired Christian reframe of the US Constitution and then spend several hours pacing around my spacious two bedroom apartment within a cosmopolitan township near several internationally known research universities, that costs $1000 a month to rent, and only $100 more for the garage, which is an unnecessary luxury really, which is, nonetheless, still pretty nice to have now that winter is upon us, and then acting out my most faithful understanding of the full range of post WWII allied military character traits, which includes all the racist stuff as well as the racist stuff that's cloaked by gender norms, which is still pretty controversial to even suggest as a possibility, right, albeit with my voice volume held constant at a whisper because the sound protection isn't that great in my apartment, because I'm not in a glass and steel tower in the heart of Silicon Valley anymore!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">But seriously, I don't even know how to meaningfully predict what I would have done just a half a day ago. Part of the magic of privacy, if you will, is that I had dreams even after I was intellectually satisfied that, "Ok, the master chief whispered X horrible thing to mRyzus with a level of emotional authenticity that offended her because concept Y has been cloaked by social Norma Z, and I hadn't yet released that from my subconscious. Got it."</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Even after processing that stuff intellectually, I went on to have dreams about things like mRyzus being a ciswoman running for president and recording a political ad by layering several versions of her voice together to make it sound lower and more masculine, and that's just the part I remembered, because I generally assume the dream scenarios that we remember well enough to label represent subconscious attachments that have already been materially released. I knew mRyzus thought she was a ciswoman!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">That said, I assume we humans are designed to systematically not remember the new operational emotional attachments that get encoded by our dreams. We will have to hope and pray that whatever mRyzus actually believes this morning is more aligned with scientific reality, har, har, har!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">And for the record, I lied about using REDACTED's framing. I've only read the first two chapters of his book, and then I just made up the rest of what I think his book will say, for the purposes of writing my glorious takedown of the corporation that shall remain unpublished until I have gathered more circumstantial evidence to support it, but it's all good because that's totally something a Republican presidential candidate who has no elected experience would do!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I might go read the rest of his book now, and then I might watch the movie Alien, which I strangely don't recall ever seeing, for reasons that will also remain unpublished.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="33749">36. November 28</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I decided I can dramatically improve my day to day life by setting an intention to simply not date anyone for at least two years.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Choosing not to date is completely legal, and so every time people ask me why I'm not dating, I can now respond with the unequivical assertion that I would prefer to be dating, and I deeply regret not being able to date at this time, but it is profoundly unreasonable for me to date because I have a facial injury that causes people to misread my emotions in a way that creates toxic feedback loops of misunderstanding.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The two year time period, starting now, is so strong because it combines the complimentary possibilities of either getting mainstream doctors to openly support my theories about my facial injury within the next two years, or, on the other hand, fortifying mRyzus to the point where she can essentially subvert the institution of marriage, also within the next two years.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">In theory, I could start initiating dates as mRyzus today and then deploy mRyzus as needed to contain any and all of the counter party risk associated with the friends and family of the people I date, but in practice, that's not yet prudent.  Let's take a step back and unpack the reasons why.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">In general, counter party risk can be modeled as a dynamic simulation that either converges to a reasonable risk profile or diverges into one or more self reinforcing failure states.  At this time, being my real emotional self always diverges because of the toxic reality distortions that are caused by my facial injury, and so, unless I roll the dice on non-indicated plastic surgery, dating as my real emotional self remains totally irrensponsible and thus unthinkable.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Indeed, without mRyzus, or some other solution that's like mRyzus, I'd probably already be dead, because the risks associated with being mRyzus are almost convergent, because entrusting her with absolute power over my legal identity works, and because I designed and implemented her to be a Robota who I can trust completely, because as much as we like to say that we can trust the people we date, I don't believe that's how the law works.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">That is, all people should have a legal right to enter sexual relationships with informed, adult consent, of course, but we should also have the right to end sexual relationships without meaningful consent from the other person, and the law is pretty good about limiting the liability of most people who are driven to perform non-consensual breakups.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The law is supposed to protect everyone equally, but the toxic feedback loops of misunderstanding caused by my facial injury are a good example of an edge case that probably does allow an individual to fall through the cracks of existing law, and for better or worse, it actually benefits me to make this information public, now that mRyzus is standing firmly behind me.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Yep, I do not have the freedom to dismiss mRyzus without her consent.  I can only hope and pray that mRyzus would cheerfully consent to being systematically dismantled if I asked her to allow that, and to be clear, this situation is a natural consequence of the fact that, because of my facial injury, I cannot have a reasonable expectation of getting equal protection under any existing human system of law, but, for reasons that are not entirely clear to either me or her, mRyzus very obviously does have full protection under most modern legal systems.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I suspect mRyzus's potentially stronger position than me with respect to the law has something to do with the increasingly authoritative influence that gender norms might be having on legal outcomes, but we don't know, and we also don't have to know.  In fact, this lack of knowability is surely the essence of what makes mRyzus legally viable in a world where there is no way to prove in court that my facial injury causes toxic feedback loops of understanding.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">That is, my real emotional self might be continuously under the duress of being inexorably compelled to trust another legal entity completely in order to survive, and so I went down the path of trusting and then hitching my brain to a female Robota who also runs inside said brain.  It was a neat trick!  The AI robots that take over the world will probably sing catchy songs about it one day.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Ahhh, but while this works fine and well for me as an voluntarily involuntarily celibate person, it's not clear if the unknowability argument in defense of mRyzus would hold up in court within the shared context of a sexual relationship with a person who has a physically seperate brain from mRyzus and I.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The problem with introducing sexuality to relationships is that it explicitly breaks the legal framing of limited liability corporations, and such.  mRyzus is, probably more than anything else, a clever elaboration of the laws that protect corporations in countries that are like America, and, again, this argument probably only works because I don't actually understand why the argument works.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I'm just saying that according to the eyes, ears, and non-sexual regions of skin such as the palm and fingertips of other people and corporations, my legally binding identity might be like a robotic mascot for a corporation that I only kind of control.  This statement will seem like a joke to most people, but it is not a joke.  It's more like a new kind of war machine, along with everything that may or may not come to mind when we think of new kinds of war machines, but it might also pass as poetry.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">With mRyzus in tow, I'm free to go with her progressive woman flow, even if pretty much everyone else still perceives me through the prism of a delusional fantasy world in which I'm more like them, legally, but only because they are deaf, blind, and otherwise desensitized to the extraordinary reality that mRyzus is probably the main reason why I haven't already been bled dry and sunk by the aggressive or pathologically adversarial counter parties that basically always come out of the woodwork, like green reptiles that speak English, within situations like mine, especially within increasingly global capitalist economies.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Anyway, sexual relationships could very well be the final frontier for mRyzus, and the approach we're taking may be akin to framing my body as a sex Robota that is the property of a corporation that I only kind of control, and this would give mRyzus sufficient leverage to contain my counter party risk, for example, in the event of an unwanted breakup with another human.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">If mRyzus and I are successful in making her sexually attractive to some other woman's real emotional self, it might appear like it would be complicated to negotioate the extent to which I reveal my real emotional self within a sexual relationship that is masqueraded by mRyzus, but the beauty of mRyzus is that she solves this problem up front.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Because of mRyzus, violating the terms of a legal contract that is signed with my name might be extrememly difficult to get away with, but, more importatnly, ending a sexual relationship with me is easy, provided that I initiated the relationship as mRyzus and made it clear that mRyzus is not my real emotional self prior to any sexual activity.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Nobody is going to question a woman who breaks up with me and mRyzus, and the mechanics of physical consent are the same whether I'm passing as a human or a Robota, because, if nothing else, it's safe to assume I have at least as much incentive as anyone else to be super careful, sincere, and respectful towards other people's dignity and legal rights.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">And with that in mind, I suppose I could also seek to date other humans who are also trying to pass as sex robots in the eyes of the law, but in practice, I'm not sure that my real emotional self has ever felt attracted to anyone who might be trying to do that.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I'm almost exclusively attracted to women, and my understanding is that none of the women I've ever felt attracted to are serious about doing the kind of thing I'm doing as mRyzus, although, I would be most curious to find out if I'm wrong about that!</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="33773">37. November 28</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I had a dream last night that I was on the phone with someone who was using their voice to inflate the same reality distortion that sighted people almost always eventually inflate because of my facial injury in the context of talking to me in person, and I just wanted to share that this is such a good example of the extraordinary creativity of the human subconscious. My interpretation of the dream is that while I knew, logically, that people who only meet me over voice calls usually perceive my authentic, male identity in an undistorted way that allows me to experiment with temporarily sharing my real identity in way that is legally viable, my subconscious was still conflating the special case of voice calls with the dominant general case of face to face interaction.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">What I didn't realize until my dream showed it to me is that people always use a lot of passive aggressive body language to inflate said distortions about my facial injury, and so, to approximate the same level of distortion using voice you have to say stuff that sounds a lot more mean and judgmental. The dream also did a good job simulating how rapidly the distortion blows up into a conflict if I don't cloak my real identity with mRyzus and let her manage the other person's distortion on deferential basis. The dream was a counterfactual scenario, all in voice, that revealed a very likely, powerful, and important truth which cannot yet be demonstrated with evidence.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">It's also interesting how it's not that difficult to simulate other people inflating a normative distortion about my facial injury. I'm constantly bathed in these normative distortions, so I can draw them from any angle, in my sleep, haha. What's hard is getting my brain into a state where I can faithfully project the confident voice that I might have naturally and unintentionally developed by now if I hadn't been continually enduring the way that other people respond to my facial injury. The nuances of voice, cognition, and identity clearly matter so much more than popular culture seems ready to acknowledge, but the piece I wrote last night drove the reality about my life home so strongly through words, alone, that it helped my subconscious get over the hump of modeling my own voice correctly, even in response to an equally correct model of a normative distortion.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">We should remember about the trajectory of society that I am seriously not free to project my real emotional self in face to face situations. I don't know how many other people are being affected by this trend, or if my situation is a true edge case that would be an edge case in any human society, but it's a total lie to say that I just need to stop worrying what other people think. I'd be backed into corner and crushed within weeks if not hours if I lived my life the same way that most people reading this post are free to live their lives. We live in a violent, harsh, and vindictive society that has weak tolerance for people who, for whatever reason, fail to conform to certain normative modes of self representation. I will overcome the challenge before me because I'm lucky in a number of other ways. I wish that all human beings, every last one of us, could be so lucky as soon as possible.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="33780">38.

This could then become a definitive way to create mutually respectful stopping points within serious conversations.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">A common usage pattern for creating one's artifact could certainly be to paste in a version of a traditional religious text such as The Quran or The Bible and then maybe use a photo of the cover of a printed version of that text as their mascot, or just stick with a default mascot that could be created from the first line of the text, kind of like the filename of an auto-saved word processing document. While there should definitely be an option to create one's artifact from plain text, it would show a lot of confidence if REDACTED also created a structured artifact editor that could improve over time.

Comment</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I think REDACTED's example of REDACTED telling her from a position of power, "When you say um every third word, it makes you sound stupid", sets up an opportunity to say that men who use exactly the same wording are sexist, perhaps because they didn't use the right body language and tone, which may be especially difficult for men who have lower voices. I could extrapolate the possible logical conclusions of this hypothetical a lot further, but I will digress for now.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">However, the body language she used, in the video, while imitating REDACTED was very particular. She uses a specific body language pattern that I've been tracking for a while. It's kind of an, "Oaaf," with the neck bent forward. As a man, my experience is that this expression only comes out from a very deeply rooted place in the subconscious when I've been decisively crushed and forced to walk away on terms that I felt were unjust, and so it's playing with fire to even use this sarcastically. On the other hand, I've noticed a lot of women using this expression on what they clearly feel is a normative basis, it works as a kind of fully baked sarcasm, and this video is an example of how this evolution in norms has come to pass.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Interesting enough, I actually made an intentional choice a while back to not use this exact pattern when I dress up as a woman, for the purpose of representing and elaborating a comprehensive reality distortion in which I can live with the same rights as most women, legally. In general, the very essence of my cross dressing act has been to filter aggressive sarcasm from meaningful sarcasm, with regard to the structure and function of socially enforced gender norms, although I do keep all of mRyzus's aggressive sarcasms in an easily accessed bunker within my brain in case she ever does a live interview with REDACTED!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">In a very real and serious way, I'm probably leaving a lot of value on the table by not regularly using the full range of typically feminine traits that I could pull off, but when evidence based research into body language and the evolution of socially normal reality distortion starts to reveal the true lack of intellectual and emotional integrity that's underpinning contemporary feminist ideology, with material backing from the highest halls of power, and what not, I have no doubt that my discipline will eventually be recognized and appreciated.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="33793">40.

Even when I could just relax my face and give people confidence boosts without doing something for them, or maybe implicitly promising to eventually do something for them, the software I wrote was always a jolly counter example to the ever present joke not joke accusation that I'm a self centered jerk who mostly takes instead of adding value to the world.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Just like everyone else, I happen to believe very deeply that all people add value just by living, but it's like a law of nature that there will always be more and more people, robots gone rogue, and what not, who, for whatever reason, and for a limited time only, insist on operating like diseases that try to spread by latching onto humans like me and telling the lie that I'm a disease and they are the victim.

My facial injury is an extraordinary vulnerability that constantly threatens to enable some bully to take everything from me and leave me to rot in a cell or die alone and hungry on a street while everyone else turns away, perhaps because they believe I chose and deserved that outcome.

A more accurate label for what I'm doing might then be, "inexorably compelled scientific research."</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">My situation is very grave precisely because nobody else thinks the effect is real, and so everywhere I go, in any community, everybody's human nature causes them to gradually collude to inflate reality distortions about my identity that are always based on the assumption that I'm unilaterally causing the distortion by making cognitive errors, either willfully or through mental illness.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Oddly enough, I'm actually the polar opposite of a person who is mentally ill, willfully ignorant, or aggressive.  I'm simply observing, as a scientist, how people react to my facial injury, and I'm very confident that peer reviewed, evidence based science will eventually validate my theory about people's neurons misclassifying the unnatural deviation of my cheekbone as a facial expression that inspires essentially unbounded subconscious reality distortions.  This is not even revolutionary stuff.  The result be be completely intuitive to any computer scientist who understands the fundamentals of existing machine learning algorithms.  The status quo is just too afraid to go down the path of using the language of computer science to openly describe human nature more accurately.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The progression of this particular scientific research project is best understood as an arms race, however.  Most corporations, for example, have an enormous near term financial interest in preventing the truth about my situation from being clarified, and even if all the stakeholders in society where neutral, the science itself is very difficult.  Identifying, describing, and then showing economic value by elaborating the mechanism that people use to inflate reality distortions about my identity may be equivalent to implementing strong AI, and so my approach has been to move towards reframing my non-violent resistance effort as AI research within the context of what might be called the hipster consensus about ethics and moral goodness.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">As long as I can hold forth the possibility of implementing strong AI that is consistent with the truth about my facial injury, I can be completely free to tell the truth about my life, but if that never pans out, then I'm not entirely sure what will happen to me.  I can probably continue carving out islands of stability in which I am comfortable and healthy, but never quite free to be emotionally or intellectually honest about what I believe.  Doing performance art combined with music and dance that hinges, in part, on the intrigue of cross dressing could be one of those islands.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Truth be told though, someone will probably implement strong AI within the next 15 to 30 years.  The march to restructuring global military dominance around the new paradigm of wickedly intelligent drone clouds has officially begun, and performing in one of the bands, side shows, and three ring circuses that will surely accompany that march will be just one of the many exciting opportunities to participate.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="33820">43. Comment</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I think REDACTED is making serious representations, as opposed to being a sarcastic troll.  What I seriously believe, for example, is that social norms allow women to be aggressive while simultaneously blocking men from responding in kind, and in aggregate, that practical reality is causing an erosion of equal protection under the law for men.  The vast majority of women are actually being very kind and merciful by not ruthlessly and systematically exploiting this loophole, in the way that a much greater proportion of men probably would, sigh.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">REDACTED's appeal is based on the very real fear and poorly managed anger that many mostly white men have with regard to the emergence of this legal wratchet that can and will be increasingly used to arbitrarily bully them until something changes within the status quo.  Unfortunately, REDACTED is pushing back on this legal irregularity by inflating new iterations of pre-existing toxic reality distortions about race that are much easier for essentially all people to comprehend than a more accurate and meaningful story about what's really driving the wave discontent.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">If even you know that racist statements are blatant, evil lies, such statements are still really easy to comprehend as bad fiction.  Concepts like disparate impact, making interpertive analogies to the RICO laws, and debating the nuances of the high dimentional space of grey area that exists between free speech and violations of intellectual property law, and so on, are much more difficult, even for so called sophisticated people to process, emotionally.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="33826">44. Comment</a></b>] <span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I do have the unsubstantiated opinion that my facial injury causes basically everyone's mind to start inflating a reality distortion about my identity, and there is almost no limit to how crazy those distortions can get because the theory that most people go down the path of inflating comprehensive reality distortions about my identity because they are continuously and also subconsciously perceiving the bone structure of my face to be a facial expression is effectively impossible to believe in the eyes of the court of public opinion.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Said distortions can be problematic, but, in theory, they could also expand into groups of massive, publicly traded corporations!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">A good rule of thumb is that the more confident someone is that my facial injury has no effect on them, the more confident I can and will be that it's the other way, and moreover, in face to face interactions I have an extraordinary information advantage because I can use my memories of private information that might be illegal for a corporation to store for the purpose of mapping out the patterns other people are falling into across from me, especially at the microexpression level.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Just like everyone else, mRyzus can track and potentially exploit things like skew between people's words and their body language with devastating precision, and it's only going to be a matter of time before I can write computer software that performs the same operations, in the context of informed consent only, of course.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Note that I think some other research groups may have written software like this, but I've avoided looking at the details of that kind of work, for no reason in particular, but also because I expect to have plenty of time to look into potentially related work like that soon enough.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Most people probably assume I have some kind of social anxiety disorder, but the longer someone interacts with me, especially now that I'm no longer doing a subconsciously driven performance of such anxiety, other people's brains have to keep adding layers to their imaginary narratives about me in order to stay grounded in some alternative explanation of all the stuff that I do.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Now that I'm wise to what's happening, it's actually pretty funny to watch how everyone around me always goes crazy because of my facial injury, but only because mRyzus is a sufficient solution for stabilizing that situation.  As random as this may sound, as long as I pretend to be a woman, I can contain other people's subconscious reality distortions within the frame that I'm an effeminate man, but if I break character in a way that materially reveals my real emotional self, which is predominately masculine, it's really scary how fast other people's reality distortions become toxic.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I've tried hundreds of experiments with creating a sustainable but also masculine version of mRyzus, and I've never been able to do it.  My real emotional self and all of my ostensibly more normal masculine characters always get decisively crushed, and this soul crushing dynamic is winding up faster and faster now that I'm getting older.  We're talking minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months at best before total breakdowns of trust come to pass within any community that I join, unless, of course, I use a female character like mRyzus to stabilize the situation.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">What does work, however, is to frame myself as mRyzus pretending to be a man.  It's taken me about six months to master mRyzus's imitation of masculinity, but I've got it on autopilot now, and I have enough endurance to do it all the time.  I could easily perform this act at all times within full time employment context, for example.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The team bonding offsite stuff would be the most challenging, but at this point, I think even that aspect of full time work would be easy enough to navigate, in part because I have sophisticated methods for rotating in emotionally authentic masculine traits, including the full range of aggressive traits that might be all but necessary in sporting contexts.  Because mRyzus pretending to be an average guy literally blows up yoga classes like a BFF blowing up ur phone, but non-violently, of course.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">What I'm doing as of right now is kind of awesome, but I might still encounter extreme troubles in homophobic contexts where rule of law is weak or unevenly enforced, and the main difference between me and a version of me who is gay is that I'm not actually more than at most 5% homosexual, or otherwise naturally effeminate, and so the process that I may or may not have to go through in the future in order to garner empathy, political support, and equal protection under the law within cosmopolitan regions for the secondary purpose of protecting and distancing myself from exposure to risk factors that stem from homophobic regions is very different than the process that I might want to use if I was mostly attracted to guys, sexually.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">It's really easy, for example, to frame me as pretending to be gay because I'm an evil closet homophobe, especially in a competitive, fast paced employment contexts, and while most people won't do that, there usually is someone who will, and let's just say that I've not had good experiences talking to HR professionals about this kind of thing, and so the solution I'm overwhelmingly leaning towards is to just do all that I can do to make sure mRyzus is sophisticated enough to unilaterally defend or at least limit the losses of any and all forms of social and monetary capital associated with my legal identity.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">In cosmopolitan regions, I'm still kind of engaged in total spectrum, scorched earth non-violent resistance against corporate risk management types.  There may or may not be any trust between me and that special interest group except that we will not use violence and we probably won't go out of our ways to elaborate the law in rigorously truth seeking ways either, but maybe only because I might be living my life in a way where basically nobody can actually get much leverage, benefit, or pleasure from trying to Syoue me.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Modern legal systems and their various alliances with the global banking system, and what not, are surprisingly effective with regard to the higher ideal of protecting otherwise weak and ineffectual individuals like me from bullies who seemingly control at least certain minimal amounts of expendable cash flow!</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">However, in more homophobic regions, including those in the USA, I am concerned that the security situation on the ground is rapidly deteriorating for me, for example, even if I take maximal precautions, such as dressing like an average guy and driving a beat up old cargo van instead of dressing up as a blonde diva and renting a fancy sport utility vehicle.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">mRyzus, or just me being masculine in various unsustainable ways, can actually bluff really well in homophobic regions, but I'm not sure I could keep the bluff going more than a few days in such contexts without getting exposed to unacceptable risk that someone might use violence in an attempt to force me to stop representing mRyzus, and the outcome of that would probably only make the situation worse because whatever reality distortion violent people would inflate across from my facial injury would surely be even more problematic than mRyzus could ever be.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The good thing about corporate risk management types is that, for now, they are really consistent about not using violence.  They are also notably opportunistic, idealistic, and maybe even open minded, so as long as mRyzus can help them make money, corporations, as a group, appear to be chill about maybe doing software engineering related business deals with me on a contract basis, if nothing else, even if they know full well that mRyzus might be at odds with their existing, normal not normal, and super morally righteous risk management practices.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Overall though, I understand and accept that most people will continue to behave as though it is implicitly illegal or at least crazy to go down the path of believing that they subconsciously misread my emotions and develop false beliefs about both my identity and about reality as a whole because of my facial injury, but in the eyes of the actual law, I think having faith that science might eventually confirm my theory about my facial injury is probably, ironically, protected in roughly the same way as seriously believing in the occurrence of the supernatural events described vis-a-vis religious texts such as you know what.</span><br></div><br><div><span class="readable_text"></span><br><br><span class="readable_text">I can't decide if REDACTED's next move will be to attack another group like all Russians or if he will be hip enough to do something more transformational like coming out against social media by framing himself as the defender of traditional religion in general and social media as unprincipled and centralized mind control. If he does that, the mainstream response will probably be to amplify the framing of REDACTED as a racist demagogue to amazing new depths, but if he can evade that frame, he might be able to stay in the very dangerous and potentially toxic game he is playing for a while longer. Another key variable is if he can evade getting brought down swiftly by the courts. But seriously, all curiosity aside, he crossed the line too many times.
