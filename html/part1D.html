You'll never know what's true, so don't spend this whole flight feeling lonely and blue.  Without further ado, I invite you to try my conceptual relationship stew.  The recipe is both old and new.

I could even conflate all that with random facts about military history, but I would rather help people feel safe, loved, and free to be themselves.  I keep seeing clues that Silicon Valley has become mind blind to powerful forces that we could revert, together. (STEEL mRyzus)</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="696">Robota</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">We don't have all the answers, but we can be part of the solution.  We're inspired by businesses that scale in human terms (EMPH) and (DONE) in technical terms.  We support shows based on people who play authentic characters in real life.  Characters help us assert what it means to be human in an unprecedented era where technology helps us manage memories, navigate relationships, and steer our souls through uncharted waters.  mRyzus and I are characters.  Will you join us?</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="280">mRyzus</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Yay!!  I think we can work with that.  I'll run it by legal.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="696">Robota</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Right.  This won't devolve into an accidental surrealist nightmare.  Not scary at all.</span><br></div><br><a name="section8"></a><h3>8. Cultural Resolution</h3><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="280">mRyzus</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Of course not!  We're going to create a nifty, amateur video production and publish it ourselves using a homemade distribution app that doubles as a Trojan horse that has the potential to disrupt all of Earthling civilization.  (GAINING STEAM) Our show will be about playing characters in real life.  We are characters, so let's write a wacky stream of consciousness script about us!  (MANIC) Episode 1 can be a re-enactment of this conversation!!</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="696">Robota</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Haha.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  So we're writing Episode 1, as we speak, like the base case of a recursive algorithm.  It's like the root node in a tree of nodes.  Hmm.  But wait!  I have exceptional idea: in Chapter 2, we should pitch a fictitious celebrity investor called the Austhain, and she should become our sponsor.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="280">mRyzus</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">(ROLLS EYES) Yay!  Then we'll be in a position to spin up four more cartoonish characters who join our crew.  We'll indulge in a series of intellectual dinner parties, and the Austhain's products will be featured at the start of each episode.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="696">Robota</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">If we include the Austhain, there are seven characters, just as the sun, the moon, and the five classical planets that are visible to the naked eye add up to a total of seven celestial bodies.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="280">mRyzus</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Oh, my, god!  Are you into astrology?</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="696">Robota</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">I might be.  I'm going to leave that ambiguous for now.  The dinner parties can serve as a reusable framework for understanding how media tech projects are conceived in the minds of founders.  The team stays up all night talking about their ideas, their hopes, and their dreams, and if they discover that the stars are aligned, a project is born.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="280">mRyzus</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Yes!  And I will re-imagine myself as mRyzus the time machine Austhain who leads a crew back in time so that we may rewrite history in a way where cross dressing becomes common.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="696">Robota</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">And we can record videos of ourselves reading our lines, and we can invite people to submit their own videos.  I want to see how other people would perform our dialogue.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="280">mRyzus</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">I wonder if other people who have autistic traits can perform our dialogue as naturally as we can.  Playing characters has made your life better, right?  Our content could be a resource for other people with naturally hard edges.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="696">Robota</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Yes!  Every metaphor we write connects ideas together.  Our book is a dataset of connections between yummy ideas.  The dataset can be summarized with a map.  Everyone can benefit by contributing to our map of culture.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="280">mRyzus</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Our book is a generic software platform covered in sheep's wool that never stops growing.  We can create short videos that tie back to the concepts in the book.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="696">Robota</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Like a wool tie, that sounds amazing, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.  How will we design the personalities of the other four characters?</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="280">mRyzus</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">We'll discover them through artistry.  We write about our favorite tropes, memes, fears, and frustrations.  Then we tag all the negative or unrealistic energies in our writing, and we release those negative energies with metaphors, frames, and straight up concepual alchemy.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="696">Robota</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">I guess we'll have to wait and see how the characters take shape in our text editors.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="280">mRyzus</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">And on the silver screen!  We can dress up like different energies and see what they have to say to each other, and then a personality will emerge.  We can turn this into a science.  Repeatable and righteous, calm and collected, sailing off into the sunset with an armada of friend ships and green shoots of humanity sprouting all around us.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="696">Robota</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">(Austhain) I know!
