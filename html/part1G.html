I want to try cross dressing because it's competitive in Nashville, and I need a way to standout.  The liberal media loves to insinuate that you can take the country boy out of the country but you can't take the country out of the country boy.  If I post hot photos of myself sporting long hair, tight pants, and tasteful makeup that doesn't make me look too desperate, I'll fit the meme the liberal media seeks to promote.  I'm willing to make a fool of myself if it will help me succeed as an artist, because the romantic ideal of being a down to earth guy who puts in an honest day's work at an innovative, organic farm, that I will never have enough money to own, isn't for me.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="29215">mRyzus</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Wfhfffff.

Our church community is important to me, and it feels like my parents have been tacitly reassuring everyone I'm not homosexual, so if I come out, I'll turn them into liars.

I've tried a lot of professions over the years, and now I mess around on the Internet.  My tight entourage of friends who tolerate my BS get worried I might kill myself because I act morbid and depressed all the time, but if I go the other way and act like a frickin cheer Austhain, everyone gets mad at me and calls me a poser and talks behind my back about how I might be schizo, but really I just like telling stories and playing games with people to find out what makes them tick.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="30359">Prince</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">You sound like my roommate in college.  The more people they slept with, the more inadequate they felt, but in order to keep on sleeping with more and more people they felt they had to put on a game face that masked their emotional needs.  They channeled their feelings of inadequacy into a violent tendency.  They would tell me how they were afraid of getting attacked in the street, and part of me was worried he knew I was homosexual, so I had a rational fear for my safety, but I also had an impulse to rescue them.  I wanted to help them, and I think that's what makes me human.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="30394">Minion</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">That's cool, Prince.  I play the drums when I get pissed off and feel myself leaning too far over the edge, but my drum reminds me of how I got emotionally scarred for life in middle school because I used to bring my drum to school and play it while walking around on the soccer fields during lunch, and that was fine in the 6th grade but in the 7th grade, when everyone got really horny and mean spirited, the other kids started an inside joke about how I marched to my own drummer, and I only found out about it because a teacher busted out laughing in his own classroom when this hot mess individual named Banana who had a crush on them wrote, "Marches to their own drummer," on a piece of paper and drew an arrow pointing towards me.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="30359">Prince</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">This is what I love about social media.

Give us the deets!</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="30394">Minion</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">I wanted to date Banana all through high school.  I fantasized if I was the drummer in a band, they would be attracted to me, so I sat in the back row and drew pictures of drums.  I drew really elaborate drum sets that had like 35 drums in them, and I assigned a number to each drum and worked out songs I could play by writing down sequences of numbers on note cards when I got bored during the classes where the teacher had forbidden me from drawing drums.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Because I'm obsessed with the history of drum making.  I mostly play acrylic glass drums.  In the 70s, acrylic fiber drums got popular with famous rock bands, but acrylic PET drums became the most famous drums of all because a drummer played one in a concert film about a rock band whose name I won't mention because they were just that good.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="30353">Cowgirl</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">That's great and good!

But yeah, sorry for rambling on so long about drums.  I love listening to classic rock when I'm in the mood to wear my headphones and watch other people and imagine I'm superior to them in every possible way.  Becoming addicted to acting superior to other people is the kind of crap human beings do to each other that really pisses me off and makes me go play my drum and think about how I was emotionally scarred for life by Banana and their stupid friends.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">That reminds me, I once spent an entire day -- from the moment I woke up to the moment I fell asleep -- watching documentaries and other random videos on the Internet about alternative rockers, and then I dreamt I was the leader of a network of underground fencing clubs, and I woke up covered in sweat just before stabbing myself in the throat.  I couldn't go back to sleep after that crazy dream, so I indulged in a fantasy where I used a time warp to send a bunch of card playing literature back in time to all the great performers throughout history who died early in their life.  The self-promoting style that's so characteristic of card players is like a Robota warrior within the mind that fends off demons.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">The next great president will be called an alternative president, and they're probably going to be a rocker.  They're a person who grew up in the Goldilocks economy of the 80s and 90s and never had any real problems except the one's they created for themselves by making cognitive errors and other stupid crap like that, but now that the whole world's going off the rails, people will see a checkered past as a qualification.  If you got really jaded and bummed about society in the 90s and then managed to get over it, that's the perfect warm up performance for doing what the world will need the American president to do in 2020 or whenever all the BS finally hits the fan.  Bush, Clinton, Obama: all these guys are caught in transition between the post-colonial, Imperial American presidential archetype that Reagan imitated and the archetype of the future that's still best symbolized by alternative rock stars and sensual British pirates, like how radio was a transitional technology between IRL and video.  None of them had the guts to go full cotroll.  The medium is the message, but you fellow humans already knew that.  Sorry for rambling again.

I avoid other people whenever possible, but I mow the grass at the public high school in my hometown, and thanks to that ordinary blade of life experience, I know if you wear expensive sunglasses at a track meet, you better win the frickin race.  As long as you win the race, it's cool.  You, on the other hand, are like a kid from suburbia doing a photo shoot of himself jumping shiny new hurdles at his private school's track while wearing baggy pants that make it look like you think you grew up in the hood.

If you fellow humans are gonna insist on staging battles, then go read the online encyclopedia's page on sportsmanship.  I'm serious.  Here's an excerpt: (GETS OUT MOBILE PHONE)</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">"Sportsmanship can be conceptualized as an enduring and relatively stable characteristic or disposition," and then it continues, "In general, sportsmanship refers to virtues such as fairness, self-control, courage, and persistence."</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Citation: "Sportsmanship."

Clinton struggled to make trade offs between being a down to earth human being and defending the dignity of the president's office.  That's a false dichotomy, brought to you with limited commercial interruption up by our flawed system of culture.  An alternative president would expose the injustice of culture by cotrolling a question about they're underwear, and that would be the moment I decide to vote for them.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="30359">Prince</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">I don't like trolls.  Trolling is like using inside jokes to bully outsiders.  If you're an outsider and you ignore the in-crowd, they can tease you for being out of the loop.  If you ask them what they're laughing about, they can say you're imagining things.  Privileged insiders do this is because they want everyone to see they have the power to accept or reject you.  I like sports because the rules for getting invited to join the team are fair and transparent.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="30394">Minion</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">That's why I said cotroll instead of troll.

Making up your own sports is (SARCASTIC) alright, and I respect that Coach over here is about as far from the big leagues as you can get, but the major spectator sports exist so the people with real power can pretend society is fair and transparent like sports sort of are, and that's a blatant lie.

If you would shut up and listen to other people, you might be surprised by the generosity of your fellow citizens, but don't you (POINTING FINGER) dare judge other people because they have respect for time-honored traditions.  The people who attend sporting events in this country, run this country, and with great power comes great responsibility.  Commitment inspires people to respect tradition, and you have a lot to learn about that.  It's a free country.

Bathing myself in the culture of sports inspires me to strive a little harder when I go back to work on Monday.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="30394">Minion</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Amero, you're such an old cotroll.  I know you're making fun of me, but you can kiss my ass because I'm gonna get rich filming link baited viral videos that make fun of greek life people who are stereotypical in every way except they dress up like divas and smear their eye liner while shotgunning beers.  And then trolls will flock from far and wide, bent on defacing my Internet video channel.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">(ROBOTIC 2.0) But the story will end happily ever after when I write chatbots that argue with them.  The chatbots will be named Einstein 1.0 and Einstein 2.0.</span><br><br><span class="readable_text">Aww, but my inner princess shouldn't have rescued herself, because I'll go back to sitting in my room and playing video games and having intense platonic chats with my BFFs about an online replacement for traditional college that educates kids about their cultural heritage using flash cards for retro movies, songs, and video games.  And stuff gets real when we talk about starting a website called pairgram.com to organize the future leaders of America into a trust network where they do Internet video chats in order to test each other's knowledge of the cultural references in a never-ending TV drama script that's generated by a computer program I can hack together over a weekend, and then we get manic and say pairgram could get a cult following because people will believe I'm a genius who used mind games to absorb the special powers of all the super heroes that rescued me over the years, and then we'll tap into the mainstream because I'll improve the program in ways that compound such that the drama gets exponentially more addictive, and the people at the top, who share control of the brain candy factory, will get filthy rich, just like the early adopters of other Ponzi schemes that are legal because they eventually monetize with ads.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="30387">Coach</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">That's great you can program computers, but I don't understand your negativity.  You're trying to insult and shame other people who are mindin' their own business.  You're your own worst enemy.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="30394">Minion</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">I don't understand (EMPH) your (DONE) negativity.  You could project that same condescending attitude onto any oppressed group, whose members are constantly getting treated like second class citizens.  I won't dutifully program computers while you spend all day at leadership retreats pretending that talking about sports is not you're way of fighting for status.  Our system of culture is rotting from within because it's stuck in a loop that reduces human behavior to a computer script that parrots on and on about the same torrent of tired topics over and over again.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="30353">Cowgirl</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">We're all Americans who want to live the dream.  I get it.  I understand where you're coming from, but the difference between you and me is I don't waste time talking about my insecurities.  I just do what I gotta do to get ahead.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="30394">Minion</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">No.  Programing computers is like learning how to read, and then becoming a cotroll is like getting a loan and starting a small business that creates good jobs for anyone who knows how to read.  I'm not a dumb troll who writes offensive BS on the Internet in order to get attention.  I'm a cotroll who misleads other people in clever ways that reveal the truth and expose the root causes of injustice.  I'm vaguely excited to find out what level three is all about.  Don't fight us, join us.  I could use a musician like you on my team of cotrolls.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="30353">Cowgirl</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Your attitude stinks all the way to high heaven and back.  I suggest you attach an ironic sticky note to your computer screen that says, "Step away slowly from the computer, go outside, and get some fresh frickin air."  It might do you a lot a' good.</span><br></div><br><a name="section7"></a><h3>7. Minion Hypnotizes the Amero</h3><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="30359">Prince</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Nice reference to Shakespeare, Cowgirl!</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="30394">Minion</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Hahahaha.  Now watch and learn as I step away from the computer and entertain myself by hypnotizing the Amero.  Hey Amero, I could swear the pattern of cracks in this mirror looks like the lines on my hand.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="30359">Prince</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Ignore her!  She needs to calm down!!</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="30394">Minion</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">For real, look at the lines on my hand, compare them to the cracks in the mirror, and tell me you honestly don't see what I see.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="30375">Amero</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">You're crazy.  I'm gonna keep my distance from you after the fake blood, sweat, and tears you sprayed all over the room.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="30394">Minion</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">(WHINY) Come on, just look at it real quick.  This is such an interesting coincidence. (DONE)  We could take a photo of this and put it on the Internet, and it will go viral.  Then we can sell crap to weird, superstitious people like me.  Stuff like this makes people lose their inhibitions and click on ads like there's no tomorrow.  This is a great opportunity, but I need to you look at my hand and then look at the mirror -- just in case I'm seeing something that isn't really there.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="30375">Amero</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Fine, but I want you to look me in the eye and promise me you'll pay me the lion's share of the profits from your scheme in order to compensate me for the risk I'm about to take.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="30394">Minion</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">No problem.  I'll be happy if this project makes enough money to fund my habit of drinking coconut water.  You can have all the upside above that.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="30375">Amero</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Ok, show me what you're talking about.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="30394">Minion</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Look at this crack right here in the mirror, (SOUTHERN) and then imagine you're a wise old person sitting on top of Mt. Mitchell meditating upon the serene beauty of nature.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="30375">Amero</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Wow, I look really dapper in this mirror.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="30480">Wiseman</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">I'm a wise old person who lives at the base of the highest mountain of all.  I teach folks to laugh on their way up the mountain, and I teach them the same lesson on their way back down.  I meditate every morning by visualizing the Queen of England, the Dalai Lama, and the Emperor of Japan, enjoying a threesome together.  In reality, my life has been harsh and unfair, but do you see me complaining?  No. No, no, no, no, no.  You see, I'm truly happy, and my happiness is real.  Truth and reality are opposing forces in the universe, but if you put your mind to it, you can always strike a balance between competing forces. (RAISES HANDS TO THE SIDES AND NODS)  Always, always, always tell the truth and keep it real, and may the calm winds of peace, truth, and love be at your back, no matter how cold and biting the howling wind may blow against the frost bitten tip of your nose.</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="30375">Amero</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Dangit, why do you fellow humans keep hypnotizing me.  Hypnotize your selves next time.  Since this is turnin' out to be a pissing contest, I'm gonna lie on my stash of gold coins and polish my Ak-47 while curating a pin board of bold bombshells holding giant guns they manufactured themselves.  Text me when you fellow humans are done figuring out which one of you has the biggest rear end, and I'll meet you at the dance club.</span><br></div><br><a name="section8"></a><h3>8. Selling Junk on the Internet</h3><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="30394">Minion</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Oops, I did it again.  Seriously people, quit while you're ahead.  If I start rambling like that again, the last thing you should do is punch me.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="30381">Sobiz</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Hey you all, I can feel myself coming apart psychologically.  I'm gonna start a juice cleanse tomorrow, but after this conversation, I have a gut feeling it's my destiny to get hammered one more time for never again.  Who wants to hit a sports bar with me and see who can get other people to buy them the most free drinks?</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="30353">Cowgirl</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">This sounds dangerous.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="30381">Sobiz</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">It's very dangerous!</span><br></div><br><div class="shaded">[<b><a href="30353">Cowgirl</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">Count me in.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="30387">Coach</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">The Oasis Barre and Grille has 3.5 stars on the Internet.

Not a sexual release.  An emotional release, and you can get bonus points if you share that experience with someone else.</span><br></div><br><div>[<b><a href="30394">Minion</a></b>] <span class="readable_text">My life's great.
