[[[__1H:Ep5: Poster People]]]

Suzy hosts a final salon where the characters channel the same gender alter ego of their inner lead alterate gender movie star.

[[Message from the Captain]]

[Suzy] Hey everyone!  Welcome to the fifth episode of TheSuzy.com Show!  We'll start with a far out fashion show.  For the main course, everyone will channel the same gender alter ego of their inner lead alternate gender movie star.

The crew and I went down below and created a fake micro blog for the Captain.  It's called, "Diva Captain."  The Captain almost had a wardrobe malfunction when she saw it, but then she decided it was beautiful, and she told us to keep it going.  Without further ado?

[Captain] (INTERRUPTS) Hey everyone, I'm reading in the micro blog voice of Diva Captain.  I hosted a feminist slumber party last night and we talked about how big media creates self-serving myths.  My BFF convinced me to exercise more in order to maximize the number of brain cycles in my life.  I'm at a party in SoCal, and hot people are coding naked in the master bedroom.  Every diva needs a fave algorithm.  Mine is the CYK dynamic programming chart parser.  What's yours?  Why do hipsters like it when I pretend to be a nice person pretending to be a mean person pretending to be a nice person?  Searching the Internet for images for the search term "fashion" is not bad.  There should be an app for this.  And remember, make it look is easy, don't trade on the reputation of others, and you are what you think about.  Back to you Suzy!

[[Far Out Fashion Show]]

[Suzy] In preparation for this episode, everyone indulged in their ultimate feminine fantasy.  We chilled out at the spa.  Then we lounged on giant cushions and discussed fashion.  One thing lead to another, and we all got makeovers.  Let's show off our before and afters!

[Operative] This is going to be the stuff of lore.  Here's my before:

[(PHOTO ep5a2.jpg, Suzy in a plain photo)]

[Operative] Lace for the win.

[(PHOTO ep5a1.jpg, Suzy wearing a lace top at the airport)]

[Agent] I'm the girl next door.  Here's my before:

[(PHOTO ep5b1.jpg, Suzy in a black dress with a pink belt)]

[Agent] Down to earth is always perf.

[(PHOTO ep5b2.jpg, Suzy at the mall with a little brown bag)]

[Writer] I grabbed this from my top drawer.  Here's my before:

[(PHOTO ep5c1.jpg, Suzy wearing a long black dress)]

[Writer] Pink is best.

[(PHOTO ep5c2.jpg, Suzy with pink lipstick in front of the science museum)]

[Salesman] Don't make me start keeping score.  Here's my before:

[(PHOTO ep5d1.jpg, Suzy wearing yoga pants at home)]

[Salesman] The universe wins again.

[(PHOTO ep5d2.jpg, Suzy wearing yoga pants at a bar)]

[Lawyer] Hey Babe, could you close the door?  Here's my before:

[(PHOTO ep5e1.jpg, Suzy is a brown dress with black tights)]

[Lawyer] Nothing tops sexy slacks.

[(PHOTO ep5e2.jpg, Suzy interacting with a reading light)]

[Dealer] Make love on the floor.  Here's my before:

[(PHOTO ep5f1.jpg, Suzy at Zucatti Park in NYC)]

[Dealer] I'm the dilettante next door.

[(PHOTO ep5f2.jpg, Suzy in the middle of dance floor at a club)]

[Suzy] Nobody ever said fashion was for the faint of heart.

[[The Salon Begins]]

[Operative] So what are we waiting for?  Let's (SHOUTING) start this salon!  Uuugghhh!!!

[Salesman] (EYES PANNING LEFT AND RIGHT)

[Lawyer] Hey people, how's it going?  What's new?

[Dealer] Nothing much, just playing some cards, solo, and riding high on another colossal wave of deal flow.

[Lawyer] How high are we talking about?  What's the volume like?

[Dealer] High enough for all the usual suspects to come out of the wood work like clock work.

[Salesman] That reminds me of a joke. Seven people from the worlds of religion, medicine, finance, tech, media, politics, and the military walk onto the top of a mountain.  The religious person says, "Oh my!  God is close by!"  The medicinal person says, "Let's get high!"  The finance person says, "Let's buy the top of this mountain!"  The person from tech says, "Let's build an infinity pool and let people swim in it naked."  The media maven says, "It's good to be on top."  The politician says, "Let's reach for the stars," and the person from the military says, "It's good to have the high ground."

[Dealer] I don't get it.  Why is that funny?

[Salesman] Because it was written by a cross dressing rap lyric generator that's on every drug ever tried by humans plus five more it designed for itself.

[Dealer] More like if we loaded your brain into the cloud so it could multiply and negotiate the armistice that prevents the drone war from ever starting.

[Writer] You fellow humans are weird, but that reminds me of a good story. Last weekend this cat I met at a dive bar told me about a burlesque drag queen who dresses up like a hamster with gold buck teeth, but she only performs for one person at a time in the back of a liquor store on the Sunset Strip.  I thought it was a scam, but the guy had a way with words, so I called up my buddies and we played credit card roulette to figure out who would go in first.  The loser went in, and all we could hear was loud music.  We were cringing and trying to play it cool.  Nobody wanted to be that person who suggests we check if everything's ok.  Right when we were about to take action, our friend came out with a wide grin and was like, "Sorry for keeping you folks waiting.  That was the best show I've ever seen.  I'm whole new person, but the show's over.  You'll have to come back another night if you want to see it for yourself."

[Agent] That's a modern day, adult fairy tale, but I've got a serious question.  How's a writer like you supposed to make a living now that print is dead?

[Writer] The game has changed but the rules are the same.  The cool kids always silk screen t-shirts with naked dudes and cuss words, but when they get sponsors, some jerk from corporate tells them to keep it classy, and it's all down hill from there.  It's the same old story.

[Lawyer] Rolling down hill all the way to the bank and sun bathing on the beach.

[Writer] Keep dreaming.  Rolling down hill is never smooth no matter what the salesman tells you.

[Salesman] (LOOKS BACK AND FORTH) Ooohhhhhhh!

[Writer] You're hilarious.

[Salesman] Bwwwaaaahhhhhhh!!!!

[Agent] People, humor me for a second.  If you take a high floor view, we see that all human dignity can be captured through the idea that everyone's promoting a personal brand.  Personal brands are always based on truth, love, and authenticity.  Brands can show appreciation for each other by giving gifts of artisanal food, hipster cred, and other commodities.  Gift givers get badges that represent their bold leadership.  There could be a marketplace for reselling these badges.  The market incentivizes brands to give wisely and responsibly.  And like magic, writers now have a way to get paid.

[Lawyer] This sounds like a Ponzi scheme.

[Agent] It's not a Ponzi scheme.  It's more like derivatives trading.

[Writer] It's all the same thing, unless you can also wear it like a gold ring.

[Dealer] Or a crypto pearl earring.

[Operative] Cash will always be king, but the boom in businesses that help people tell stories about their lives has only just begun.  Everyone has a database about their lives because of social media.  These DBs are like autobiographies, and people are in an arms race with corporations to storycraft their lives.

[Lawyer] This cesspool of free content you envision sounds like a breeding ground for unrumors.

[Operative] What's an unrumor?

[Lawyer] It's a rumor I know is false, but I'm gonna tell it to you anyway.  Let's be clear, this is not a true story, but do you see that celebrity over there?  They're married, but I saw her last night, at the hotel across the street, entertaining a group of hot people by the cabana, and they took one of them back to their room.

[[SunsetSuzy]]

[Operative] Let's play with that idea.  Have you fellow humans seen the drag queen from Silicon Valley who's living in hotels on the Sunset Strip?  Her name is SSuzy.  She's a fake blonde bimbo, and she writes open source software that adds leverage to her assets.  Rumor has it she's producing a film about herself.  Let's beat her to the starting line and do a parody of her film.  I'll be SSuzy, and you fellow humans can be characters in her entourage.

[Dealer] Why do you get to be SSuzy?  I wanna be the star.

[Operative] This is my idea.  I'm SunsetSuzy.  You can be the star of our next project.

[Lawyer] This feels mean.  She's probably a nice person.

[Operative] Imitation is the highest form of flattery.

[Writer] I have an idea for the simple story.  She's putting together a team, and she has to resolve drama within the team.  Their goal is to create a movie about SunsetSuzy.  This is very meta.  It's a nod to her roots in Silicon Valley.  The movie will end with a mind-bending finale that shows the team filming scenes from earlier in the movie.

[Agent] Sounds like SSuzy's a washed up rockstar, and she needs to get the band back together.

[Dealer] Her co-star and partner in rhyme is the SRobot.  She has never not been the CEO and the SRobot was the CTO of her last company.

[Operative] She finds the SRobot playing computer-aided chess in the park.  The SRobot is happy, and it has no desire to join her company, so she challenges it to a game of chess.  No really, she challenges it to a game of chess.  Did I mention that she challenges it to a game of chess?  She can do this all day.  If she wins, the SRobot has to join her crew.  If she loses, the SRobot gets to brag.  The SRobot laughs and accepts the challenge.

[Dealer] SSuzy wins by cheating.  She has technicians in an unmarked white van.

[Operative] Let's use a pink van instead.

[Dealer] Done.

[Lawyer] They need a hacker house.  The next scene shows SSuzy and the SRobot touring potential pads.

[Salesman] They turn down a penthouse and go with a beachfront fixer upper.

[Agent] That night, SSuzy and the SRobot go for a walk by the beach in the moonlight.

[Writer] Is there sexual tension between SSuzy and the SRobot?

[Agent] Nope.  SSuzy and the SRobot both have mastermind energy, but they own that side of themselves in different ways.  Their dialog should be an eternally rising spiral of ideas.

[Operative] The next recruit is SRadtronic.  They were their first engineering hire.  They are a brogrammer.  SSuzy finds them at a beer garden.

[Salesman] SSuzy embarrasses them by dancing on the bar and holding court with his bros.  She gets their friends to peer pressure them into joining her crew.  They do shots and the scene ends when SRadtronic jumps on a table and declares he will join SSuzy's crew.

[Operative] The next recruit is SRogamath.  He was like SSuzy's executive assistant on steroids.  She could not have built the business without him.  SSuzy finds him at a pretentious yoga retreat.

[Lawyer] SSuzy respectfully slays the yoga retreat with haut pink yoga pants and a matching, strappy crop top.  She places her mat next to his and passes him notes inviting him to join her new company.  By the end of class, he's ready to work.

[Operative] The next recruit is SSue.  She was the community engineer.  SSue'n SSuzy ran Silicon Valley during the boom years.

[Writer] SSuzy finds her at a charity mask ball.  SSue is in the photo booth with two hot guys, and SSuzy crashes the party within the party.  She and Sue make a scene and walk away, holding hands.  They drive to a friend's house with the top down and their hair blowing in the wind.  SSuzy closes the deal while they sit on a balcony and sip champagne.

[Operative] The final recruit is SSusan.

[Agent] She's teaching youth from an underserved community.  SSuzy arrives towards the end of class.  SSusan implores her to make an inspirational speech and SSuzy does her best.  They walk to a nearby coffee house and have a heart to heart.  The joint is wholesome and eclectic in a way that would never make money as a franchise.  SSusan talks about when she was an assistant teacher and she observed a student who was trying to create a 2D srobot on paper during a 3D srobot building class.  The head teacher thought the student was learning disabled, and that inspired SSusan to go into teaching.  SSuzy listens with great interest and then talks about her plan to rewrite history.  SSusan says she'll think it over.

[Writer] Were you the kid who made the 2D srobot on paper?

[Agent] I don't recall, but using this story without attribution might be cultural appropriation.

[Writer] Ok, so, we cut from there to a montage of scenes showing everyone doing their part to trick out the hacker house.  SSue is teaching contractors how to do their job.  SRogamath is out shopping and SSue calls him with a ridiculous list of items that he needs to find.  SRadtronic is sporting a tool belt and building a table out of his old surfboard.  The SRobot is coding furiously.  It's oversized monitor glows ominously and casts a dim shadow of its cranium onto the wall of the pixel-shaded corner in which it sits.

[Operative] These scenes are interleaved with SSuzy having coffee with journalists and business gurus.  She is making grandiose claims and they're hanging on every word.

[Dealer] At the end of the day, they sit around the surf board room table, and SSusan shows up at the last minute.  SSuzy asks what made her change her mind, and she laughs and says she's been hacking in the cloud all day with the SRobot.  SSuzy glares at the SRobot.  It shrugs, points at SSusan, and says, "It was her idea to surprise you."

[Agent] SSusan says they finished coding the site.  The SRobot rolls out a giant red launch button and says the time machine is ready for launch.  SSuzy just needs to type in the space time coordinates and press the giant red launch button.  SRogamath blurts out, "Don't press the button!" and the joke falls flat for everyone except SSuzy, who laughs uncontrollably for way, way too long.

[Operative] SSuzy and the SRobot get into an argument about whether to go to 1580 and visit Shakespeare or 480 to visit King Arthur.  They settle the argument with a mock dual.  The fight ends inconclusively.

[Lawyer] SSue picks a winner and suggests, "Let's go dancing at that bar where the majority of people in the room are cross dressing."  At the bar, the SRobot gets into debt while playing pool with a crew of media moguls, and it goes double or nothing to try to get out of debt.

[Salesman] SSuzy sees what's going on and saves The SRobot by using the time machine to freeze the pool table and redirect the SRobot's shots like a scene from a cyberpunk virtual reality conceptual demo.  The SRobot runs the table and wins the bet.

[Dealer] The moguls are incredulous.

[Operative] That's enough content.  In order to film the finale, we need a second camera crew, who will film the first camera crew, and we should write witty dialog for when the characters are between takes.

[[Big Fiction]]

[Writer] Perfect.  Outsourced writers could take this idea and turn it into a screenplay, but before I confirm our order, let's consider other possibilities.  What about a soft porn version?  If porn was less stigmatized, cross dressing would be more popular too.

[Operative] No.  Does anyone else have any serious alternative ideas?

[Writer] Porn is serious.

[Operative] I said no.

[Agent] What if we frame SSuzy as a famous historical figure like SusanB Anthony.  We could base the story on the life of Anthony, but translate it to modern times and show her working to ensure cross dressers have equal opportunity to, say, be the public face of a financial services company.  We can tap into Anthony's brand, but we won't have to pay licensing fees.  Nobody owns the sequence of events in her life.

[Salesman] That doesn't sit well with me.  We need to create something original.  What about a startup drama that's based on a dream team.  We can create composite characters out of famous tech CEOs and write the script in the style of comic books.

[Dealer] How's that original?  There's at least three levels of plagiarism there.

[Salesman] Remixes are original if you add enough layers.  Most people won't know what we're doing.

[Operative] We could add another layer by rotating in players from a team of all-star athletes.  That will make it harder to prove which CEOs we're making fun of.

[Writer] That's a winning idea.  Let's do some improv and see what happens.

[Salesman] I want to be The Majestic Mike.

[Lawyer] No way, matey, you're a mashup of all the characters except The Majestic Mike.

[Salesman] Matey?  Really?  I'm the person who makes the clutch shot at the end.  I'm The Majestic Mike.

[Lawyer] You're good at talking the talk, but I'm the person who walks the walk, and that's why I'm The Majestic Mike.

[Salesman] Let's compromise.  We can both be The Majestic mike.

[Lawyer] That works for me.

[Dealer] If both of you are The Majestic Mike, then I'm the Vatmyn.

[Operative] No no no, I'm the Vatmyn.  You can be the Court Jester.

[Dealer] That's a terrible idea.  It's like you're an Uber-fan, and I'm a Park Bench.

[Agent] Come on Dealer, you should be Hex Sleuther.

[Writer] We need someone who can program on our startup dream team.  Hex Sleuther is a great name for the l33t h4x0r on our team.

[Dealer] We need a programmer, and that's why I'm the Vatmyn.

[Writer] Can the Vatmyn really code?

[Dealer] Of course they can.  The Vatmyn can do anything.  Operative, why don't you be an Uber-fan and I'll be the Vatmyn.

[Operative] Sure, I'll be an Uber-fan.  I could own you in a troll fight.

[Dealer] Uber-fans are fictional, composite characters.  The Vatmyn is real.

[Agent] Knock it off you fellow humans.  So get this, I'm Robber Rich.

[Writer] What??  You want to be called Robber Rich, all right, that role is yours for the taking.

[Lawyer] Are you trying to be the Head Faker of the team?

[Salesman] Nooooo!  I get it, she wants you to think that, but she's trying to be the Team Coach.

[Lawyer] That's it!!  You can see it in her eyes.

[Agent] It's not like that.  If we're going to be great, we need a Robber Rich who looks out for the team as a whole.  I wouldn't want to play any other role.

[Writer] I'll round us out by being The Billionaire.

[Agent] That's so cliche.  I thought you were a writer.  How could you be satisfied with something so cliche?

[Writer] How could I not be satisfied?  I'm The Billionaire.  This is a dream role for me.  A dream role on a dream team.  I like the sound of that.

[Operative] Ok people.  What's the idea?

[Salesman] I have the domain whatlooksgood.com.  Let's keep it simple and curate photos of me.  It's a photo sharing site for me and my friends.

[Lawyer] That's cool if we open source the code and start a decentralized network so that other people, such as myself, can run our own instances.  It'll be like crypto-currency for users of photo sharing sites.

[Writer] We gotta be more zippy and offbeat.  What about hampstertwerk.com?  We can do a tribute to the original Internet meme from the dot com era.  Hamster Twerk represents the meme coming full circle and biting its tail.

[Operative] I'll chew on that idea.  I also have radyogic.com.  We can publish yoga routines that are optimized for every sport.  Like yoga for basketball, yoga for football, yoga for baseball, and so on.

[Dealer] Can we do yoga for hockey?

[Operative] Yes, we'll have every sport.  We can even make up new sports.  We're the startup dream team.  This'll be a walk in the dark for us.

[Writer] Let's monetize by selling neon sneakers.  SSuzy's such a fly person.  We should decorate her kicks with a silhouette of Suzy going for a spin on the runway.

[Agent] SunsetSuzy was not part of this idea, but I like it when you hit the edges without looking.

[[Appearance by the President]]

[Operative] Let's run with Radyogic for a bit.  We're in a war zone.  We need to find a reporter who will interview an international peacekeeper who is using our app to enjoy a healthy lifestyle, even during a time of war.

[Agent] That's not an ideal.  Let's show the peacekeepers using our site to teach programmers about yoga.

[Operative] That's fair.

[Lawyer] (REPORTER) Thanks to a new website called Radyogic, kids in this war torn region do yoga in a place that was previously used to train soldiers.  I'm here with a peacekeeper who's become a celebrity because of the yoga for soccer class she teaches.

[Salesman] (PEACEKEEPER) Teaching is the least we can do.  These programmers are inspiring.  They're not afraid, and their optimism has been felt far and wide.  I'm fortunate to have been influenced by them.

[Operative] (MASTERMIND) Yes. (DONE)  Our traffic is up and to the right because of news stories like that.  The next step is a big money ad buy for American viewers.

[Salesman] Let's be bold.  Our CEO hypnotizes a drug company executive in order to summon an expert on yogic philosophy.

[[The Operative Hypnotizes the Dealer]]

[Operative] Hey Dealer, let's do yoga together in front of this cracked mirror.

[Dealer] We're pretending to do an ad for prime time TV in America, right?

[Operative] Don't think about that.  Go deeper into the pose.  Let go of unspoken assumptions that no longer serve you, and imagine you're a yoga expert.

[Dealer] I look sexy when I stretch like this.

[Bendi] My dearest friends, I see you've come to reflect on the circular ladder of the seven chakras.  The Captain represents the root first chakra, our seat of security.  Good for her.

I represent the crown seventh chakra, in all its divine glory.  The most you can hope for is a partial understanding of my story.  Keep trying, and you'll be pleased with the results.

As for the rest of you, a riddle presents itself.  Who wants to test their wit first?  The early urchin eats the least worst! (CHAMELEON)

[Agent] I'm the sacral second chakra.  I'm all about new experiences.

[Salesman] I'm the solar plexus third chakra.  I'm nothing if not confident.

[Lawyer] I'm the throat fifth chakra.  I can make an argument for it.

[Writer] I'm the third eye sixth chakra.  I see the big picture.

[Bendi] Oh Operative, you're the heart fourth chakra, love incarnate.  Do you wish to be immortal?

[Operative] I want to be known as an innovator.

[Bendi] Staying relaxed and present is a necessary mindset for innovation.  Continue your yoga practice, and your wish shall be granted.

[Dealer] Huwahh!!  That was refreshing!  But what were you thinking?  When a yoga expert asks you if you wanna be immortal, you say (EMPH) maybe (DONE)!

[Operative] You were trying to trick me!

[Dealer] No I wasn't.  You lack faith.

[[The Outraged Diplomat]]

[Operative] Let's end the salon on a more uplifting note.  We'll dive headlong into a reverie about SunsetSuzy the time ship captain, who goes back in time, in order to rewrite history, so that cross dressing becomes common.

[Writer] SSuzy needs a sword, so she commands SSue, SRadtronic, and SRogamath to find the court of King Arthur and bring back Excalibur.

[Lawyer] The first wave of time travelers reports they spent many years following Arthur to the battle of Camlann, where SSue pretended to be the Lady of the Lake.  She caught Excalibur when Sir Bedivere threw it into the lake.  SRogamath gets down on one knee and presents SSuzy with the fateful sword.

[Writer] We should include dialog from the old country.

[Lawyer] Why, it's honorable of you to raise up the canonical cycle of spiritual rebirth in English history, but we should shift focus to the 1580s in London, when pirate ships roamed the seas like technology startups, and when Shakespeare might have exchanged letters, in secret, with Galileo, about the mechanistic nature of religious belief.

[Agent] I like that period because of Sir Walter Raleigh.  He founded the first British colony in America.  That colony failed fast because the supply ships went on detours to steal gold from Spanish treasure ships, and then, after personally leading an expedition to South America to steal gold from Spanish outposts, Raleigh wrote a book that contributed to the legend of El Dorado.  When the outraged Spanish diplomat convinced the King to behead him, his last words were, "Do it man, do it!"

[Salesman] Raleigh was rumored to have expressed atheistic beliefs at the tavern of Ralph Horsey, so let's have SSuzy, the SRobot, and SSusan go there and find Shakespeare and her wife Anne Hathaway chilling in a dark corner of the tavern.

[Dealer] Shakespeare should be the ultimate cotroll, a queen of pop poetry who uses humor to own her mastermind energy.  Anne can make fun of hipsters who frame themselves as the voice of reason, those people who think they're adding value by suggesting there might be a simpler way to solve the problem at hand.  Anne is self aware that he does that.  Their self-awareness sets us up to drop hints that our character concept was the inspiration for the western canon.

[Operative] Nice frame.  SSuzy should dazzle Shakespeare by introducing herself with a topological interpretation of Raleigh's life, not because Raleigh is the hero of our story, but rather because the topology makes fun of the loud mouth in the room in a way that shows off Suzy's great game to Shakespeare.

[Lawyer] Yeah, and the SRobot pitches Shakespeare on their project to rewrite history so that cross dressing becomes common.

[Salesman] Shakespeare already thought about this.  She tells a story about how the gay Roman Emperor and military leader Hadrian could have used his reign at the apogee of the empire to turn the Roman military hierarchy on to the pleasures of cross dressing.

[Agent] Oh my! To make this work for science fiction fans, historical events should play out the same way because the rise of Christianity overshadows Hadrian's social movement.  After the fall of Rome, people will remember Hadrian was a cross dresser, but their actions will not be influenced by their new memories.  Religion has the power to define the cultural frame so completely that there are no side effects between eras with different religious frames.  God takes care of the details.

[Operative] Let's do it.  Also, Shakespeare saw the court of King Arthur as a pivot point in which the memory of Hadrian's movement is re-imagined within English culture, but now that SSuzy's telling her about the world 500 years into the future, Shakespeare loves the idea of defining herself as a second pivot point in which the the deep philosophy of cross dressing is re-imagined for the enlightenment era.

[Agent] If the crew goes to ancient Rome and encourages folks to cross dress, Shakespeare can convince the show boating Raleigh to cross dress.  The memory of these events helps SSuzy start a non-violent movement in the present time that raises awareness about the injustice of wealth disparity, thereby enshrining cross dressing within the norms of mainstream American culture.  Boom.

[Dealer] Yes!  They should start at the court of the Emperor Titus and his scribe Josephus.  Suzy hypnotizes the SRobot and summons Jesus, but they get God instead.  God speaks like Plato, and she's angry with SSuzy for summoning a fictitious composite character that never existed, and the Roman palace comes crashing down.

[Operative] SSuzy and Susan escape back to the future in a dramatic scene where they must leave the Robot behind.

[Dealer] And then, the SRobot renames itself Yzuss and tells stories about the future in order to pull off cross dressing in Rome.  Yzuss Hollywoods itself for the benefit of the entire Roman army, and it ultimately succeeds at influencing a lot of the rank and file soldiers to become a cross dressers.

[Writer] When SSuzy and SSusan return to the future, they read an online encyclopedia article about the SRobot's victory as Yzuss, and the second act of the play shows them starting a non-violent movement in which cross dressing becomes a symbol of everything that's not quite right about human civilization at the dawn of the post-gunman era.

[Dealer] Yup.  Inviting people to cross dress and write their autobiographies in the style of TheSuzy.com Show proves to be more disruptive than occupying buildings, parks, and sidewalks.

[Operative] Got it.  I'll send around the transcript of this conversation, and we can take this idea to the next level tomorrow.
