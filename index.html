Todd Perry has shipped TheSuzy.com Show as open source software, at <a href="https://github.com/tperry256/thesuzyshow">https://github.com/tperry256/thesuzyshow</a>.<br>
<br>
I'm going to do a thorough edit of the text with the goal of making the overall frame equalivalent to the frame of <a href="http://sharkinjury.com">SharkInjury</a>, which makes reference to Suzy's emergence within the real world.<br>
<br>
I will also be making videos of myself reading the whole text, twice, first in a serious manner and then in the manner of parody, and video of myself reading SharkInjury will be broken up into seven parts that well be included as the footer content for Book 1, Episodes 1 through 7.<br>
<br>
The last piece of of the puzzle will be to create an open source content distribution platform called WhatLooks and run an instance of that software called WhatLooksGood (WLG) that will host content like TheSuzy Show, in a form where users can manage the structured data that is associated with the text.  WLG will also have a membership fee so that I can afford to host the content independenly of however many people are accessing the site.<br>
