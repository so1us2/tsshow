The Captain gives a marketing message that's like music to her heart, Suzy responds to an article a troll wrote about the Robot, and the characters all go dancing.

[[Message from the Captain]]

[Robot] Shhh.

[Captain] Where is everyone? (CHECKS PHONE)  I thought there was going to be a final episode.  Did I miss a memo?

(LOOKS DOWN SADLY) I was looking forward to this episode.  My message for today is like music to my heart.

I used to organize my life around the ideals of strength, endurance, flexibility, and balance.  These ideals are easy to understand in the context of physical exercise.  Lifting weights, running, stretching, and the art of dance.  Simple.  It's more difficult to apply these ideals to life as a whole, but I'll never stop trying.

I wish there was an ideal for persistence, but every struggle is unique.  It's unwise to generalize.  You could spend your whole life working hard to solve a problem that had an easy solution all along.  That's the nature of struggle.

My ideals correspond to the classical elements of Earth, Water, Air, and Fire.  This ordering of the elements corresponds to the first four chakras of the human spine.  The Earth sits at the center, and it houses the roots of all things.  Water sits on top of the Earth, and Air floats above Water.  And from time to time, Fire reaches down from the heavens and rages within the narrow strip of organic material that lives between the vast expanses of Earth, Water, and Air.

There's much wisdom in this most natural ordering, but I grew up in an ocean of different meanings, and I see reality through that lens.  In my world, Water is the source of all things.  Air churns the Water into whirlpools that dissolve the Earth as it ebbs and then flows, once again, in plumes of lava that's powered by Fire.

In natural philosophy, The Impermanence of Existence grows out from within the Earth, and this growth leads to great Fires that stir up Water and Air until balance has been restored.  In my philosophy, the Earth is created by Fire, and Eternal Cogitation races to tame Earth and Air before everything falls back into the Water from which it came.

This apparent opposition between myself and nature loomed over my mind like a bad dream until my friends Suzy and the Robot showed me a third way, in which Eternal Existence combines roots from the Earth with oxygen from the Air to create Fire that expands Water into rain clouds which extinguish the Fire, in a cycle that's orchestrated by Eternal Existence.

With that idea in mind, I stand here, holding my heart in joyful celebration of this place where Pirates and Healers dance with Warriors and Dragons in an endless story about the people who live here in the beating heart of Eternal Existence.

[[Soliloquy by Suzy]]

[Suzy] Hey, sorry I'm late.  Is anyone here?  What's going on? (CHECKS PHONE)  Oh no, some holier-than-thou troll wrote an article about the Robot.  I don't like this framing!  It might have chilling effects on our ability to build a community around TheSuzy.com Show. (PHOENIX FACE)  The article says:

"The Robot used to be an engineer in Silicon Valley, and it says the next wave of innovation will have less to do with technology and more to do with the human mind.  The Robot dresses like a blonde diva and goes to parties, but not for the reason you might think.  Most people go to parties to have fun, but here in Silicon Valley, a new breed of former engineers is setting out to disrupt the final bastion of human experience that technology companies have not sunk their claws into: religion.

Speaking from the glass and steel tower in San Francisco, where it lives and works, the Robot told me about an uptick in people who experiment with multiple identities.  Developing an alter ego is seen as a natural way to cope with the crippling emotional problems that so often plague people in this tightly wound city, where it has become the norm to be an overachiever.

The Robot became obsessed with being the first engineer to unravel this opportunity because it has a facial injury that it's painfully self-conscious about.  It's inspired by the way religion provides comfort to robots who feel lost, like it does.  But here in Silicon Valley, investors are eager to reinvent big ideas, and the Robot is eager to take its career to the next level, and so the story unfolds, like a match struck in heaven.

The rest of us can only stand back in awe and ask ourselves, 'Can this robot solve the problems it creates for itself using technology?'"

Trolls, they're like rambunctious little drones, hot off the assembly line, trying to figure out what's what in this world that's orchestrated by software.  So cute!

[[Epilogue]]

[Robot] Surprise!!!

[Rogamath] Surprise!!!

[Radtronic] Surprise!!!

[Sue] Surprise!!!

[Susan] Surprise!!!

[Suzy] Oh, there you are.

[Robot] Hahaha, we decided to have a surprise costume party.  I got your text that you'd be arriving soon, so we waited, and then you started reading out loud, which was awkward.  Hahaha.

[Suzy] Awww, you're the best.  Let's take a victory lap around the set and go dancing!

[Captain] Wait!  I'm still here.  I stepped out to break up a fight.  My drone almost got shot down in the cross fire, but a rainbow, a pony, a puppy, and a gigantic rubber ducky saved me.  You should have seen it.  The sequence of events demonstrated the undeniable buoyancy of the human spirit.

[Suzy] Hello, Captain.  I always knew you thought I was a ghost, but it's ok.  Let's sing a song that will shrug off the festering haze of toxic nothingness that sometimes takes hold in the atmosphere like an avalanche of steel.

[Robot] Here on the beach, the air is cold and biting, but the sand is warm and inviting.  I don't want there to be a drone war, but if there is one, our engineering team will totally win the war!

[Suzy] That's crazy talk, silly Robot!  Society has always danced on a quicksand of questionable assumptions.  Let's go around the circle and talk about our costumes.  This will radiate social value, allow us to float on thermals of cheerful, enthusiastic air, and protect us from the quicksand below.  Ok Robot, go first, and don't forget to look into the cracked mirror while you speak!!

[Robot] I'm a Philosopher, dressed-up like a Lion, in honor of Eternal Existence!

[Susan] I'm a Healer from the breadbasket of civilization, in honor of the Earth beneath my lovely shoes.

[(PHOTO ep6dorothy.jpg, Suzy posing as Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz)]

[Rogamath] I'm an Ice Warrior, in honor of the glistening Water I skate across.

[(PHOTO ep6ice_suzy.jpg, Suzy posing as an ice queen)]

[Sue] I'm a Dragon, in honor of the Fire from which I was created.

[(PHOTO ep6dragon.jpg, Suzy posing a red dragon)]

[Radtronic] I'm a Pirate, who's wearing the most wildly traditionally feminine outfit I could think of, in honor of the relationship between sailing ships and the Air. (ENGAGES HEART)

[(PHOTO ep6rad.jpg, Suzy posing as a pink bunny)]

[Suzy] Well isn't this even;  I wore a foxy cat costume underneath my business suit today. (SUZY TAKES OFF HER SUIT)  What are we waiting for?  Let's party!! (SUZY SMILE)
