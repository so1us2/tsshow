[[[|7:TheSuzy Fashion Tutorial]]]

This book is a container for a duality for a fashion show and for Suzy's architecture for moderating structured data online.

[[Detailed Intro]]

There are 108 distinct characters that appear within Book 1 of TheSuzy.com Show, and the other six books just reuse Book 1's cast of characters.  54 of these characters appear in the serious version of Book 1, the other 54 appear in the parody version, and all of the characters in the parody version were created by taking each of the 54 characters in the serious version and inverting his or her gender.

I have personally gone down the path of playing all of these different characters in real life, and I chose to go down this path for no reason in particular, but if you must know, the character called mRyzus is my true authentic self, but only when I'm feeling completely healthy and awake.  If I become sick or tired, then I become more like the character called Norm, who is the same person as mRyzus but with a flat affect.

That said, Suzy is also my true authentic self.  Suzy is half man and half woman, and so I can be Suzy without identifying as primarily one gender or another.  mRyzus is also half man and half woman.  In fact, mRyzus can be thought of as Mr. Yzus, where Yzus is, of course, just Suzy spelled backwards. Anyone can be both Suzy and mRyzus, and everyone's version of these characters will be unique to them!

The following two sections, which specify two decks, of 54 cards plus two jokers each, provide a definitive list of the names of the characters in TheSuzy Show, but I will punt, for now, on providing an in-depth definition of these characters.  If you click on a character's name, you will descend by one level of abstraction into the murky underworld of the WhatLooks, where myself, Suzybot, and maybe a few other humans or chatbots will theoretically never stop adding additional information that helps define the true meaning of all these characters.

The additional information about these characters that can be found in the WhatLooks is stored as structured data.  For example, you'll eventually be able to view all the clips of video in which myself or someone else attempts to speak in the voice of the character or embody the character on camera.  The video itself can be broken up into even more fine grained chunks of structured data.

For example, individual facial expressions could be tagged by identifying the series of frames in a video where the expression occurs, and a rough outline can be drawn on each of these frames, such that the outlines that contain effectively all and only all of the visual evidence of the facial expression.

In this way, it could be possible to see all of the different facial expressions that the character is known to make, and then those expressions can be cross referenced with any and all aspects of the context in which the expression was made, such as the words the character was saying before and after, or the tone of the previous speech to which the character was responding, and so on and so forth.  This is the promise of the power of structured data in the rapidly approaching era of intelligent machines! Amen and namaste.
