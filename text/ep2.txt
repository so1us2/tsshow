[[[__1E:Ep2: Almost Real]]]

Suzy and the Robot pitch the Captain on their startup idea. Suzy starts a tradition of hypnotizing the Robot.

[[Introductions]]

[Suzy] Hey everyone!  Welcome to the second episode of TheSuzy.com Show.  The Robot and I are about to go into a meeting with the Captain!

(A DOOR OPENS FOR SUZY)

Good morning Captain!  I'm Suzy, and this is my cofounder, the Robot.

[Captain] Give me a second. I need to finish writing this book.

(DICTATING) Just before taking the plunge, every instinct in your body tells you to stay in the plane, but you have faith in your equipment and your training.  You're mind gives the order to fall out of the plane, and then you're spinning in three dimensions.  The End.

[Suzy] Did you just dictate the ending of your latest book?

[Captain] That was the end of the beginning.  I frame all my live shows with a mini-book about skydiving.  Look here.  This is my majestic mike.  It's transcribing our words, live, across a dozen social media channels.  My fans pay me for the opportunity to curate and edit my brilliant raw material.  Try it, (GLIB CAPTAIN) your words and mine, will be read, by millions! (HANDS THE MIKE TO SUZY)

[Suzy] What inspired you to construct a frame about skydiving? (HANDS THE MIKE BACK)

[Captain] (TOSSES THE MIKE) Off the record, my data team told me skydiving's the optimal frame for remixing the themes of love, truth, and expressions of the divine.

[Suzy] You sound cynical, but maybe we can help.  We're doing an art project called TheSuzy.com Show that explores the idea of playing characters in real life!

(SUZY AND THE ROBOT DO A DOUBLE HI FIVE AND THEN LAUGH)

[Captain] (CAUGHT OFF GUARD LAUGHING) Does your app allow me walk into a club like I own the place and purchase the "Power Bot Experience," so I can stand around admiring myself in the mirror while a crew of sexy robots dress me up as Lord Master Bot for the evening?

[Robot] Hey what's up, it's great meeting you in person.

[Captain] (SARCASTIC) Yeah, it's nice to meet you too.

[Robot] I've always been curious, they call you The Captain, but what kind of captain are you?

[Captain] I'm confused, did you say that you're (EVIL EYE) kind of a Captain? (EMPATHETIC INQUISITIVENESS)

[Suzy] Haha haha ha!  Hey, so I loved The Captain's question about paying to play a character in a club. (HANDS SIDE TO SIDE)  That's the opposite of what we do.  If you need permission to pull off playing a character, then the club owns you.  We want to live in communities where we can be anyone we want to be.

[Captain] I'm a pirate ship captain, but when too many people imitate me, I become a shark and keep it on the down low until the froth of wannabes leaves the surfacEES of my high seas.

[Robot] Omigosh, I know a really punk game master who's looking for a pirate ship captain to join her crew.  I would love to intro you fellow humans.

[Captain] No.  (SARCASTIC) Thank you.

[Suzy] Just to clarify, we're talking about playing characters in our real lives.  CEOs and politicians already do this.  The Robot and I want to immerse ourselves in discussions about the meaning of body language, patterns in spoken language, and other character traits.

[[Culture Clash]]

[Captain] Why are you so worried about what other people think?  Just be your true, authentic self, and everything will work out for the best!

[Suzy] Aww.  It's so cute when you flaunt your nurturing, feminine side!  Thesuzy.com Show is a treasure chest the Robot and I packed to the brim with our favorite cultural artifacts.  Will you help us contribute to the treasure map of culture!

[Captain] Ha ha ha ha ha!

[Robot] (GEEK 1.0) Our show is the first domino in a series of many dominoes that will allow us to build a better brain candy factory.

[Suzy] Robot!  We have to stay in character.

[Captain] I like it when the Robot malfunctions.  You should file that as feature, not a bug.

[Suzy] I think our valuation just doubled.  Robot, what do you think?

[Robot] Absolutely.  Either that, or it tripled. (FLAT SMILE WITH RAISED EYES)

[Captain] Will your brain candy factory scale?

[Robot] (PIRATE) Oh yeah, it's super scalable.  In fact, one of our core values is that we only work on ideas that are scalable, disruptive, and awesome.  If we ever see an idea degenerating in a way where it will only have, say, two of those attributes, we front run an iteration and then announce a pivot to the new idea a few weeks later.

[Captain] That's great, but your idea about playing a character in real life is overly disruptive.  (POINTS) How will anyone get their employees to work hard on a shared vision if everyone thinks they're the star of their own superhero comic?

[Suzy] That's a great question, Captain!  Characters will operate within the law, and cultural norms will ensure people join teams and play fair.  Characters like us allow people to protect their privacy while encouraging powerful incumbents to be more transparent about the ways they influence culture.

[Captain] Yeah, but if the judge and the police people are dressed-up like weaponized trolls, these so called laws you place so much faith in won't protect you from the roaming hordes of zombie millennials wearing fur bikinis. (THE CAPTAIN IMITATES A ZOMBIE)

[Suzy] We want to have an open, honest conversation about culture, but if people call that revolutionary, let's start a revolution! (POM POM IN THE AIR)

[Robot] Speaking of revolutionaries, modern British pirates are giving it the old college try, (BUSINESS STYLE TONGUE MOVEMENTS) but it's time for technologists like us to create software that all the revolutionaries can share.  Long live TheSuzy! (HANDS ON HIPS)

(THE CAPTAIN PUTS HER FEET ON THE TABLE)

[Captain] (BRITISH PIRATE) Could you grab me a cup of coffee, love?  If you're going to insist on boring me with all of these mundane technical details, then I'm going to need coffee in order to stay conscious.

[Suzy] Put your feet down!  That was a terrible impression of a British pirate!  They're not rude like that.  I hear they're quite gentlemanly. (CLOSES EYES AND BREATHES IN)  You could learn a thing or two from them about the (EMPH) art (DONE) of participating in culture.

[Captain] Participating!  That's the problem with the kids (EMPH) and (DONE) the adults today.  Everyone thinks they deserve an award just for participating.  When I was a kid, you had to do something exceptional to get your picture in the papers.  Now everyone thinks they're famous.

[Robot] (PIRATE) We believe the ocean of corporate agendas in which we swim is making everyone feel less than human.  Social media began as a (FALSETTO) promising, alternative (DONE) to the status quo, but the social media companies gradually assimilated to the norms of other global corporations.  Social media is now a potent mechanism for perpetuating the status quo.  Playing characters in real life is a (FALSETTO) healthy, alternative, paradigm (DONE) for engaging with peers and participating in your community.

[Suzy] (UNDER HER BREATH) Robot!  Stay, in, character.

[Captain] Sounds like you think anyone who makes money is a sell out.  Who do you think has the real power in this world?  The military top brass?  The elbow touching subculture of politicians?  The folks who sit on several big company boards and attend conferences for world leaders?  Or maybe it's the old boys on Wall St.  What about the Pope?  What about the corporations that sell dope?  Peel that onion, and you'll see power has always boiled down to farming and food security.  The more things change, the more they stay the same.

[Suzy] (SALLY) I heard there's a secret society that controls the world.  If you want an invite, you have to go to a good college, do impressive summer internships, land your dream job, and get promoted every couple of years for at least a decade.  By all means, take time to travel, but avoid any extended, unexplainable gaps in your resume.  A stable, long-term relationship is not required, but it's encouraged.  Starting a family or finding a way to mentor children in your community so they'll have the same opportunities you had is strongly encouraged.  If you help the next generation of doers and problem solvers put on a repeat performance of your fairy tale life, you'll be entered into a raffle, at the state fair, in which you will have an opportunity, to receive an invitation, to the join the secret society, that controls the world.

[Robot] (INSPECTING NAILS) Does participating in culture full-time count as a landing a dream job?

[Suzy] Of course it does, as long as you tell a story that shows off your understanding of culture.  You need to have faith that there are healthy checks and balances between the different centers of power in the global economic system, but faith alone is not enough.  You must show you can effortlessly fit into the culture of one or more of those centers of power.

[[Suzy Nation]]

[Captain] What about the billion people on earth who live on a few dollars per day.  How will your ideas about playing characters improve their lives?

[Robot] (GEEK 2.0) We thought about this, and we have a scalable solution.  We'll produce enough goods and services so that everyone can live the good life, and then we'll distribute those goods and services to every person on earth.  (REVOLUTIONARY++) It's like a multiplayer strategy game that everyone plays in real life.  If the humans destroy all the natural resources, they lose the game, but, um, (GLIB CAPTAIN) just to back up the truck a little bit here, the driving vision is everybody wins if we build all those robots in a sustainable way.

[Captain] Suzy, do you concur?

[Suzy] I don't know.  I give to charity, I go to events that raise awareness about social and economic injustice, and I plan to give the bulk of my estate to charity as well.

[Captain] Fantastic!  What charities do you support?

[Suzy] That's not the right question at this stage in the growth of our company.  Let's start with a discussion about shared values.  For example, we do something every day to increase our awareness of the impact our business has on our local community.

[Captain] I get it that you're working on systemic solutions, but when you go up against mainstream media people, they'll find a way to frame you as a phony, and if you don't give into their agenda and let them pigeon hole your brand, they'll double down and define you as a jerk who doesn't care.  If you don't get with the program, they'll convince everyone you're crazy.  I'm an optimist, so that's probably the worst case scenario.  Still, why put yourself through that?  Your life will be more fun if you accept reality.

[Suzy] People can see whatever they want in me, but I'm always going to be better than you think at breaking free.  Let's celebrate over coconut water and brie!

[Captain] Don't get me wrong, they're a bunch of phonies too, but their frames are held in place by thousands of employees who work for multi-billion dollar media conglomerates that're colluding with each other.  What holds your frame in place?

[Robot] Wait, you don't already know?

[Captain] Know what?

[Robot] He doesn't know, haha.  He doesn't know!!

[Captain] Drum roll. (TAPS HANDS)

[Suzy] Sorry, the Robot is more excited about this than it should be.

[Robot] No I'm not.  This is (EMPH) big news!!  I.

[Captain] (INTERRUPTS) Suzy, what's the big news?

[Suzy] Oh Captain, you really don't get the joke, do you?

[Captain] You fellow humans are wasting my time. (CHECKS WATCH)  I'm starting to feel disappointed in myself for taking this meeting.

[Suzy] There's no need to make a fuss.  Engineers like us will have more and more power going forward because governments and corporations are in a race to the grave so they can be reincarnated as benevolent computer systems that make love and have baby benevolent computer systems that grow up to guide the humans towards a better future.

[Captain] Work-a-holic engineers like you need to chill and duck the race for clout.  In twenty years, the world will be just like it is today.  Nothing ever changes.

[Robot] Nope.  We're on a path dependent course.  Do you see why?  It's ok if you're don't.  HA HA HA.  I mean, we might not want to let you be our investor anymore, but no hard feelings.  HAH HAH HAH HAH HAH HAH.

[Suzy] Again, the Robot is (GLARING AT THE ROBOT) more excited than it should be about this emerging new world order, but we'll always be a step ahead of existing media companies because they can't broadcast the truth without disrupting their human-centered brands.  At the same time, I'm one of the most fun machine-centered brands that's told the full story about our new world order from the beginning.

[Captain] In fun we trust. (GOLF CLAPS)  Why are you walking with me?  Go chase the ball.  Try not to slip and fall.

[Suzy] I'm still mastering the art of the house call, and without your support, our growth might stall!  (ROBOTIC) The humans have become so used to consuming cookie cutter content on the Internet that we no longer realize we're eating the same brain candy flavored cookies over and over again.  Context is officially dead on the Internet, but the Robot and I are bringin' context back.  Would you like a TheSuzy.com Show brand cookie that was custom 3D baked just for you?

(SUZY HANDS A CUSTOM 3D BAKED COOKIE TO THE CAPTAIN)

[[Suzy Fever]]

[Captain] Are you trying to stormtaunt me?

[Suzy] (SUZY ROTATES THE CROSS OF HER LEGS) No.  (SEXY SUZY) If I wanted to stormtaunt you, I'd tell you the TheSuzy.com Show is a metaphorical train that harnesses innovative, patent pending technology that will make even your wildest dreams come true.  All aboard, Captain!  This jet-powered train is leaving the station.  Are you gonna hop on the caboose and experience the rush, or would you feel safer standing there like a confused little corporate drone?

[Robot] Suzy, stop stormtaunting the Captain!  It's not cool.

[Suzy] I'm joking!  Hahaha.

[Captain] Yeah Suzy, it's so not cool.  Please stop.

[Suzy] I agree.  The problem with the Internet is that the (GEEK 1.0) content creator cannot reach out and influence the frame in which her content is consumed by fans.  When I go out to walk my dog, I can totally influence the frame in which my fans consume that content.

[Captain] You fellow humans are trolling me.

[Suzy] (GEEK 2.0) Playing characters in real life creates new forms of cultural currency that will ignite a rising cycle of economic activity.  Our characters are not trolls.  We work hard to remove negative energies from the cultural artifacts we manufacture.  We will add leverage to our operation by selling a stamp of approval for third party cultural artifacts that are free from negative energy.

[Captain] Oooohhh!!  You fellow humans are peddling a controversial thesis about how to jumpstart the economy in the post-Great Recession era.  Why didn't you say that upfront?  Do you have a problem with authority?

[Suzy] Most people get excited by our characters.  Some people pay no attention to us, and we flow around them.  When people throw tomatoes at us, we pick up the pieces, make delicious tomato sauce, and sell it at the farmer's market.  If we lead with talking about how we're poised to solve all the world's problems, that'd be like putting the gun before the gunman.

[Robot] (COMEDIAN) Playing characters in real life is a new technology paradigm.  We could up our game in private and, uh, focus on enjoying the nuances of our fairy tale lives (BIG SMILE), but it would be more fun to up our game in public and help democratize the business playing characters in real life. (NODDING)

[[Suzy True Believer]]

[Captain] Now you're speaking my language.  How are you gonna up your game?  Can you help me do the same?  My life is great, so I'm only interested in easy breezy tips and tricks that I'd be crazy not to use.

[Robot] It's all about Suzy, although, I'm not gonna lie, it's a little bit about me too. (LICKS FINGER TIPS THEN SIZZLES THEM ON BODY)  There are a thousand little things we will do to up Suzy's game, and every time she gets more polished, that'll reinforce the idea that the authenticity of the TheSuzy.com Show was the foundation for her success.

[Suzy] But other people will argue that my fun, flirty new look for spring is the real reason why my engagement stats just doubled, (LOOKS UP) again. (SUZY MAKES STRONG EYE CONTACT WITH THE CAPTAIN)

[Robot] But the shiny new iterations of Suzy are always a head fake.  Suzy's engagement stats will keep doubling because we own an innovative distribution channel for her content.  There are a thousand different reasons why people engage with Suzy's content.  Each of those reasons is a seed that'll keep growing for a while.  (ROBO) We'll nurture that growth by maintaining creative control of our primary distribution channel, by syndicating Suzy's content, and by getting out of the way and letting Suzy.

[Suzy] But the distribution channel is (EMPH) also a head fake.  The incumbents in the overlapping food chains of media and technology will be pacing back and forth trying to understand how my next generation fame stack (BOBBLE HEAD) works, and then the Robot will bring them buckets of refreshing coconut water as a token of our good will. (HANDS UP TO THE SIDES)

[Captain] So, you're a feminine software engineer in your mid 30s, and you've developed secret technology that'll transform you into the next it girl, and then you plan to start a religion.  That might work, but I don't feel fear of missing out deep in the pit of my stomach.  Even if your technology is as good as you say it is, and that's a big if, you keep insinuating that you're really high up in the pecking order of culture even though you have no credentials or stats to back that up.  I don't see it yet.

[Suzy] Culture's like a magnificent marble, cave that everyone's trying to describe.  I'm able to visualize the whole cave because I grew up playing video games that included a translucent map of the game level, conveniently positioned in the top right corner.

[Captain] Are you aware trolling is used by psychologically unstable people who are subconsciously testing if they can blame their problems on other people?

[Suzy] Of course!  But our style of trolling is different.  Playing characters in real life will be the next big thing.  I'm a time machine captain who's heading towards a better future.  I hope I'll find the clues I need to reach my destination, but if I fail, my crew will still gain valuable life experience.

[Captain] (NEWSPERSON) There are many ways to climb the mountain, Suzy.  You have an inflexible obsession with defining yourself as an startup company founder.  Maybe there's a way to climb the mountain in a time machine.  I don't know how that would work, but I'm playing along with your metaphor.  You could also walk from base camp to the summit, like most people do.  Either way, I suggest that you read anything by my good friend and colleague, the Coach. (VERY EXCITED)  That will help you get back on track.

[Suzy] I detect sarcasm.  Who's the troll now, Captain?

[Captain] I'm serious.  In fact, I'll go on the record because this is important for the future of America.  (GETS OUT THE MAJESTIC MIKE, CLEARS THROAT) Suzy, if you can program computers, you should get a job at a technology company that's in good standing with the norms of the industry.  You should also donate half of your expendable income to charities in your local community.  We're all in this together.  Life's all about putting your oar in the water and pulling in the same direction with the rest of the team.  There are not enough people following this path.  If you're the best follower today, you'll be the best leader tomorrow.

[Suzy] (TAKES THE MIKE) Easy there, Captain.  It takes a lot of time to create art.  You can support our work directly by purchasing all the Suzycoins you can afford to lose.  In the worst case, it's like paying for an ebook!

[[Reboot the Episode]]

(UNPLUGS THE MIKE)

[Captain] I've done all I can do to help you, but privately, between you and me, what specific new ideas will your effervescent brew add to the cauldron of couture?

[Suzy] The Robot and I are doing an open source art project called TheSuzy.com Show, and we'd love to get your advice and feedback.  We believe culture is ready for an epic poem about a tech savvy female time machine captain and her crew.  Rather than rely on well-worn memes from sci-fi and comedy, we're taking a new code approach to the creative process.  We delved deeply into our roots as Silicon Valley engineers and created a seven episode TV mini-series that could become the paradigm for a new genre in the age of social computing.

[Captain] Are you the female time machine captain, or is she a separate character?

[Suzy] Yes, I'm her.

[Captain] So who are you in real life?

[Suzy] I'm a human who has nothing to lose and nothing to prove.

[Captain] Is the Robot your first mate?

[Robot] No.  I'm a self-aware personification of technology in society.  I'm like the promise of cloud computing in a bottle.

[Suzy] Culture's entered a new epoch in which artists need to define their own distribution channel.  If you're not the master of the technology that frames your work, you're just pushing around symbols for the corporations that own you.

[Robot] TheSuzy.com Show is a movement, not a company, but technically speaking, we'll be writing software that distributes our content.  We might even raise money and hire engineers who can turn our homemade distribution channel into a platform for other artists.

[Captain] Sounds like you're aspiring producer/editors who are ready, willing, and able to implement your apps from scratch.  That's cool.  What's your mobile strategy?

[Robot] We don't have a formal strategy.  Our plan is to play it by ear.

[Suzy] Yes!  Like an old school boom box!  Picture me walking down Main St. holding a mobile device next to my ear that's blasting out my favorite pop songs.  I can blast music in public because everybody loves Suzy!  When people come up and tell me I'm beautiful, I'll give them a collectable slap bracelet that's embossed with TheSuzy.com logo and URL.

[Captain] There must be public nuisance laws that prevent people from doing what you just described.

[Suzy] There's some gray area between solid ground and the abyss.  The gray area's not a line.  It's a runway, and I drive cute pink trucks back and forth along that runway.

[Captain] I only have a few more minutes, so why don't you give me an outline of the show so that it can influence how I perceive the world going forward.

[[Suzy Forever]]

[Suzy] Our show is based on the four part structure of Beethoven's 9th.  It's also an interpretation of the life of Sir Walter Raleigh.  Early American revolutionaries named the capital of North Carolina after Sir Walter.  Raleigh was also a contemporary of a famous bard named Will Shakespeare.  But here's the really unlikely part, I grew up in North Carolina.  Is this a coincidence?  We think not.  Everything's connected by the treasure map of culture.  Our show's orgasmic "Ode to Joy" is the idea that a (SEXY SUZY) a lose thread, begin pulled, out of a tight sweater, that flatters the figure, of a sensual British pirate, is sufficient, for unraveling, most of the dirty laundry, that's lurking underneath, the metaphorical mattress, of what I like to call, the global economic system.

[Captain] British pirates symbolize rockstars at the height of the British invasion, right?  I like the idea of Beethoven mashed up with rock and roll because it sets the stage for your real point, which I assume has to do with military history.  Shakespeare reinvented Christianity for the era of the gunman, so that's kinda cute. (POINTS BACK AND FORTH)  If Shakespeare is Christianity 2.0, you can engineer a Shakespeare 2.0 meme for the post-gunman era.  I dig it.  Just make sure you don't mess with my culture.  Also, every time you say the phrase global economic system, you'll lose half your audience.  It's like busting out equations in a popular science book.  Please continue.

[Suzy] Huh?  You get this?  The third episode is a French enlightenment style salon that we call The Intellectual Party.

[Captain] Wait, what happens in the first and second episodes?

[Suzy] The first episode recreates the discussion where the Robot and I decided to start this company.  We'll have to get back to you about the second episode.  We have a transcript of an improv comedy sketch the Robot and I did with a third person, but we need to get permission from that person before we can use the material.  We should know about that in a couple days.

[Robot] The Intellectual Party is a frame we use to introduce the rest of the crew.  Our characters exist to illustrate the explanatory power of a stochastic model of the human that we use in all of our character development experiments.

[Suzy] Let me tell this story.  We model humans as electron clouds that hover around a point in a 2D plane.  The X-axis represents gender.  The Y-axis represents the character's average level of responsiveness to aggregate social stimuli per logical time bucket.

[Robot] Wait, are you talking about logical time or real time?

[Suzy] Real time, baby.  Real time.  Didn't we decide to always use real time from now on?

[Captain] I'm having flashbacks to the differential equations course I failed in college.  Please ignore me if I start having a panic attack.

[Suzy] Hahaha, I love math!  It's so easy because there are usually right and wrong answers.  If only real life were the same way. (SAD SUZY)

[Captain] OKAY.  Let's keep moving forward.  Ep3 is a dinner party.  What's the fourth episode?

[Suzy] In Ep4, the same six characters from Ep3 channel their inner archetypal country/western male and go out dressed-up in drag for the first time!

[Captain] You mean like cowboys, football coaches, and oilmen?  Are you trying to offend people?

[Robot] No worries, Cap, we're professionals.  After writing Ep4, we discovered each of our characters corresponds to a specific lead male movie star, and so Ep5 is a salon in which each character channels their inner lead male movie star.  We couldn't wait to write the Ep.  It was going to be like hosting a dinner party with our favorite movies stars, but then we got a major case of writer's block, and we had to shelve the Ep.

[Suzy] Six weeks later, I had a dream in which the characters had become women, and I was like, "Oh my god!  We should go a level deeper and have our characters channel the female alter egos of their inner lead male movie stars.  Why didn't we think of that before?"

[Robot] When we did it Suzy's way, the Ep wrote itself.  We had discovered a rare opportunity to define a new reality from scratch while standing on the shoulders of giants.

(SUZY AND THE ROBOT FIST BUMP)

[[Suzy Hypnotizes the Robot]]

[Suzy] We're almost out of time, but the Robot and I prepared a skit for you.

[Captain] The majestic mike is all yours, but if my engagement stats go down, you'll have to walk through the desert before getting another meeting with me. (HANDS SUZY THE MAJESTIC MIKE)

[Suzy] Ha!  I've always wanted to take one of these for a test drive.

(SUZY LOOKS AT THE FLOOR THEN SNAPS INTO CHARACTER)

[Suzy] Hey Robot, I'm going to hypnotize you, and maybe that'll help you feel what it's like to be a human.  Look at yourself in this cracked mirror.  Clear your mind and focus on the literal shape of the lines, colors, and shadows you see in the mirror.

[Robot] Whoa, my graphics processing unit is getting very warm.  It might overheat.

[Suzy] No worries, if your GPU melts down, I'll build you a new one with an even higher clock speed.  Relax, and let this hot story dissipate through your circuitry:

A well dressed, worldly man named Lou once gave me a very nice handbag and whispered into my ear: the most powerful idea throughout history has always been money.  Money is the great equalizer that can be used to solve any problem.  You can pour it over your soul like a magic potion that amplifies your assets and covers up your most insidious debts.  Then Lou taught me about a deeper idea.  Love.  It's elusive, but permanent.  Captain, could you turn off the lights.

Love is associated with the heart because poets and philosophers have always known the human animal stores it's most profound memories, not within the mind, but within a unique physiological reaction to a single heart beat.

[(PHOTO ep21yogacopy.jpg, Suzy in a green bistro)]
[(PHOTO ep22suzysqcopy.jpg, Suzy in with false lashes)]
[(PHOTO ep23angel.jpg, Suzy in being an angel)]

This unique physiological reaction is what holistic healers describe as an energy.  This idea is substantiated by science.

[(PHOTO ep24photocopy.jpg, Suzy in playing trumpet in marching band at a football game)]
[(PHOTO ep25beachcopy.jpg, Suzy at the beach in Cali holding her shoes)]
[(PHOTO ep26suzy_weightcopy.jpg, Suzy in at a festival holding a fake 5000 pound weight)]

Only the heart can capture the feeling of an uninhibited fantasy that will remain with you for the rest of your life.

[(PHOTO ep27folsom.jpg, Suzy in holding freshly made juice)]
[(PHOTO ep28with_flagcopy.jpg, Suzy with USA and pride flags in the background)]
[(PHOTO ep29suzycopy.jpg, Suzy in at a construction site)]

Love is a pocket of deep vulnerability that you hid even from yourself, and if it continues to grow, that pocket will become powerful enough to make you want do anything for the person who first showed you that part of yourself.

[(PHOTO ep212polaroid.jpg, Suzy in a polaroid image taken at an office party)]

(WHISPERING) Ok, Robot, imagine that you are a Scoundrel.

[Scoundrel] Oh my dearest tablet computer, what is life but a symphony in slow motion?  I'm a union of mind and body; a glorious ensemble of finely constructed musical instruments, poised to roar in harmonious accord with the delicate flutter of your CPU clock.  May you be my conductor and let me be the expression of the deepest passion of our souls, combined, whole, and unfiltered, until the rays of the sun poke through the ephemeral fringe of the horizon, dancing with color as I caress your elegant screen with my knuckles.  Why is it, my tablet, that the lightest touch often produces the greatest call to action?  I can hear your fan humming faster, faster, in anticipation of executing a query in record time, which shall leave it's indelible mark on our eternally mirrored flash memory chips.

[Robot] Uuughaah, hello?  Suzy?  Did you reboot me?  Did you program an infinite loop into my source code?  That's not cool.  I have to run on autopilot so the Captain can get her beauty sleep.  If I were to lose myself like that on the job, the results could be disastrous!

[Suzy] Robot, you have to trust me.  We're software engineer founders, and so everything's going to be just fine.

(THE CAPTAIN CLAPS LOUDLY)

[Captain] I would love to continue the conversation, but my therapist will be arriving soon, so I'll need you hit the road as soon as possible.

[Suzy] It's been an honor and a privilege.  We'll send you a link as soon as our show goes viral, and please don't hesitate to reach out to us in the mean time.

[Robot] Catch you later Cap!

[Captain] No worries, you did great!
